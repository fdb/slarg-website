bio: >-
  Mona Hedayati is an Iranian-Canadian artist and researcher whose work moves
  across sound, technology, and embodied experiences of displacement. She was a
  PhD researcher at SLARG and completed a joint PhD in the arts at Sint Lucas
  Antwerpen (KdG) and ARIA at the University of Antwerp, as well as in
  interdisciplinary humanities at Concordia University, Canada, in June 2025.


  Her research-creation project, *Reverb-Resonate: Sounding the Affective Frequencies of Migration*, brings together science and technology studies, computational arts, and sensory studies to explore how sound can register the emotional and material textures of migratory life.


  Mona holds a BA in Translation Studies, an MFA in Digital Media, and graduated from the Advanced Master of Research in Arts and Design at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG).
