  <!--StartFragment-->


  **Mona Hedayati** is an Iranian-Canadian artist and researcher whose work moves across sound, technology and embodied experiences of displacement. She completed her joint PhD in the arts at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG) and ARIA at the University of Antwerp, and in interdisciplinary humanities at Concordia University, Canada, in June 2025.


  Her research-creation project, *Reverb-Resonate: Sounding the Affective Frequencies of Migration*, weaves together science and technology studies, computation arts and sensory studies to explore how sound can register the emotional and material textures of migratory life.


  Mona holds a BA in Translation Studies, an MFA in Digital Media and graduated from the Advanced Master of Research in Arts and Design at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG).
