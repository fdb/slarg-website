  Brussels. in 2024 he started his PhD research in the arts at the Antwerp
  Research Institute for the Arts (ARIA) - Sint Lucas Antwerpen & University of
  Antwerp. His research "Empowered Care" roots in the co-initiation and
  co-maintenance of housing projects for and with people who are in financial
  and legal precarity (the homeless, sans-papiers, asylum seekers). Dimitri
  explores how care can be extended from the private nuclear family towards a
  broader group of people in need through sharing living space based on mutual
  aid, allyship and love and the ethical complexities of it.
