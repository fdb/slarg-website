bio: >-
  Sam Vanbelle is a Belgian illustrator and lecturer in the Applied Masters
  program at Sint Lucas Antwerpen. They are conducting a one-year artistic
  research project titled "Exploring gender, diaries and binaries through visual
  essays" at SLARG. The source material is their archive of sketchbooksâ€”a safe
  space for drawing about fertility, gender, transitioning, and parenthood.
  Through this work, they aim to create a socially relevant collection of
  accessible visual essays. A small piece of quiet, visual activism in a world
  where the space for gender variation is often narrow.
