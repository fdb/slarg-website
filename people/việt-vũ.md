  Việt Vũ (Phạm Quang Trung) is a filmmaker, audio-visual artist and reseacher
  in the arts. He has so far completed a series of audio-visual works in various
  socio-political zones, including Vietnam, Portugal, Hungary and Belgium. 


  His works, focusing on accenting repressed voices of queer and neglected communities in a globalizing world, have been shown at various European and Asian film festivals. After winning "The Most Promising Filmmaker from South East Asia" Award at the 2nd SeaShorts Film Festival in Malaysia in 2018 for the debut fiction short "Ant-Man", Viet made his docufiction "The Eternal Springtime", which became eligible for the Oscars nomination thanks to winning "Best Documentary Award" at 66th International Cork Film Festival and "Best Director" at Baku International Film Festival. In the same year, his experimental "My Own Room" was granted the prestiged Wildcard Award from Vlaams Audiovisueel Fonds (VAF, Belgium). 


  Viet obtained a Master Degree in Documentary Film Directing at Doc Nomads in 2021. Since September 2022, he is doing a PhD in the Arts at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG) / ARIA (University of Antwerp), entitled "Queering the censorship: A (self-)investigation through the first-person perspective of an experimental filmmaker in Vietnam."
