In the same year, his experimental "My Own Room" was granted the prestiged Wildcard Award from Vlaams Audiovisueel Fonds (VAF, Belgium). 


  Viet earned a Master’s degree in Documentary Film Directing from DocNomads in 2021 and was also selected as a Berlinale Talents alumnus the same year. Since September 2022, he is doing a PhD in the Arts at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG) / ARIA (University of Antwerp), entitled "Queering the Censorship: (Self-)Investigations of an Experimental Filmmaker in Vietnam."
