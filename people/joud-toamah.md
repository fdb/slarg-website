  Joud Toamah is a multidisciplinary graphic designer and artist researcher from
  Syria, currently based in Belgium. Her practice spans publishing, video,
  sound, and image-making, engaging with Islamic cosmology, displacement, and
  the re-membering of personal and collective memory.  Her current artistic
  research focuses on water cultures, exploring water as a site of witness amid
  militarization and infrastructural violence during and after dictatorship in
  Syria, along the watery places she loves by the Euphrates.


  She is currently coordinating the Advanced Master of Art and Design Research (AdMa) and co-lecturing a course on Islamic Ways of Knowing and Aesthetic Practices with Ruth Loos.


  Joud has participated in residencies at Frans Masereel Centrum, Futures Photography, and Morpho. Her work has been presented at Photoforumpasquart, FOMU â€“ Museum of Photography, Beursschouwburg, Globe Aroma, and Constant.
