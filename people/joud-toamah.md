  Joud Toamah is a multidisciplinary graphic designer and artist-researcher from
  Syria, currently based in Belgium. Her practice spans publishing, video, sound
  and image-making, engaging with displacement, Islamic cosmology and the
  re-membering of personal and collective memory. Her current artistic research
  centres water cultures, approaching water as a site of witness, remembrance
  and resistance to militarisation and systemic erasure in Syria along the
  Euphrates.\

  \

  She coordinates the Advanced Master of Art and Design Research (AdMa) and co-lectures *Islamic Ways of Knowing and Aesthetic Practices* with researcher Ruth Loos. She has undertaken residencies at Moussem, Frans Masereel Centrum, Futures Photography and Morpho. Her work has been presented at Monty, Photoforumpasquart, FOMU Museum of Photography and Beursschouwburg among other venues.
