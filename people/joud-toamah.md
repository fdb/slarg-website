bio: >-
  Joud Toamah is a multidisciplinary graphic designer, artist and researcher
  from Syria, currently based in Belgium. Working across multiple media,
  publishing, video, sound, and image-making, her practice engages displacement
  and re-memberance across personal and collective memory. Her current artistic
  research centers on water cultures, and on water as a site of witness and
  resistance amid militarization and infrastructural violence during and in
  post-dictatorship Syria along the watery places she loves on the Euphrates.
  She is currently coordinating the Advanced Master of Art and Design Research
  AdMa, and is co-preparing a course on Islamic Ways of Knowing and Aesthetic
  Practices with Ruth Loos.


  She has participated in residencies at Frans Masereel Centrum, Futures Photography, and Morpho. Her work has been presented at Photoforumpasquart, FOMU – Museum of Photography, Beursschouwburg, Globe Aroma, and Constant.
