bio: >-
  I am a graphic designer and artist researcher from Syria currently based in
  Antwerp, Belgium. Themes of re-memberance and gestures of repair flow as a red
  thread across my work. At the moment, I am doing an artistic research
  centering water traditions along the Euphrates that were inherited
  generationally to dream and imagine its flow otherwise against
  state-controling structure in post dictatorship Syria.\

  \

  I participated in residencies at Frans Masereel centrum, Futures Photography and Morpho. My work has been presented at Photoforumpasquart, Fomu Museum of Photography, Beursschouwburg, Globe Aroma and Constant.
