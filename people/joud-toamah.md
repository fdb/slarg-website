bio: >-
  Joud Toamah is a graphic designer, artist and researcher from Syria, currently
  based in Belgium. Her practice engages re-memberance, displacement and
  gestures of repair within marginalized spaces, narratives, and environments.
  Her current artistic research focuses on water cultures along the Euphrates
  against the ongoing militarism and infrastructural violence in the watery
  places that she loves in post-dictatorship Syria.


  She has participated in residencies at Frans Masereel Centrum, Futures Photography, and Morpho. Her work has been presented at Photoforumpasquart, FOMU – Museum of Photography, Beursschouwburg, Globe Aroma, and Constant.
