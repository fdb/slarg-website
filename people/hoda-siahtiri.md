  **Hoda Siahtiri** is a Brussels-based audiovisual performance artist and researcher whose work centers on grief, memory and ancestral vocal heritage. She completed her PhD in the arts, *Singing The Silences*, at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG) and ARIA at the University of Antwerp in June 2025.


  In her research, Hoda comes to voice by singing in proximity to the lineage of Bakhtiari women from western Iran, exploring how embodied vocal practices can hold and transmit intergenerational memory.


  Her performances, creations and ceremonial works have been presented at various festivals and cultural venues across Belgium and Europe.
