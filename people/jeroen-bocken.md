bio: >-
  Jeroen Bocken is an artist, teacher, and researcher based in Antwerp. His work
  spans digital imaging, material studies, and object-based research, often
  starting from technological objects and the visual languages of measurement,
  control, and neutrality. By combining photographic and digital processes, he
  examines how scientific aesthetics, industrial materials, and computational
  systems shape the production and interpretation of images.


  His research explores the enduring power and biases of images and how these are amplified today by predictive algorithms. Rather than expanding visual diversity, these systems often narrow and standardize what we see.
