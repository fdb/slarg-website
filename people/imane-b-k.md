bio: >-
  Alongside Tunde Adefioye, I have researched threads Towards Braver Spaces and
  questioned the fostering of collective and sustainable spaces that center care
  and well-being in multiple communities. \

  \

  Within Constant in Brussels I continue to develop artistic research about different subjects that stand at the intersections of technology, art, and the socio-political sensitivities that arise.


  I have collaborated with my colleagues and students at Sint Lucas Antwerp and other educational spaces, to create coaching sessions, workshops, and re-learning opportunities at the masters in fine arts with a digital context.
