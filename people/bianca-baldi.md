bio: 'Bianca Baldi is a South African artist, based in Brussels. In her work
  Bianca deals with the role of narrative as a means of knowledge production in
  both fictional and historical contexts. She is interested in the staging of
  identity and history and explores these themes in photography, film, writing
  and publishing, which she often combines in the exhibition format as
  installations. Bianca is doing a Phd in the arts at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG)
  / ARIA (University of Antwerp), entitled "Play-White: Racial Passing and
  Embodied Images." '
