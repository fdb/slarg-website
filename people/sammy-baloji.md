bio: >-
  Since 2005, Sammy Baloji has been exploring the memory and history of the
  Democratic Republic of Congo. His work is an ongoing research on the cultural,
  architectural and industrial heritage of the Katanga region, as well as a
  questioning of the impact of Belgian colonization. His use of photographic
  archives allows him to manipulate time and space, comparing ancient colonial
  narratives with contemporary economic imperialism. His video works,
  installations and photographic series highlight how identities are shaped,
  transformed, perverted and reinvented. His critical view of contemporary
  societies is a warning about how cultural clich√©s continue to shape collective
  memories and thus allow social and political power games to continue to
  dictate human behaviour. He started in September 2019 a PhD in Artistic
  Research titled "Contemporary Kasala and Lukasa: towards a Reconfiguration of
  Identity and Geopolitics" at Sint Lucas Antwerpen.
