bio: >-
  Ann Laenen is the Dean of Sint Lucas Antwerpen. She studied Arts and Theatre
  Science and obtained her PhD in arts education. Trained as a musician, her
  interests have always been interdisciplinary, bridging education, the arts,
  and research. Her professional career began at the education department of the
  Royal Opera House in Brussels, after which she started experimenting with
  digital tools in education and communication. In 2009 she combined her
  academic expertise with project coordination and development in the arts on
  both national and international levels. Among other roles, she oversaw the
  artist residency programme for Valletta 2018, Cultural Capital of Europe, and
  co-curated several exhibitions. Participatory design, community work, and
  co-creation are central to her projects.


  Her current research focuses on group dynamics within art projects, the role of design thinking in creative processes, and the ethical dimensions of art practice. She is open to working with PhD researchers whose projects connect to these themes, and welcomes proposals that engage with collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches in the arts.
