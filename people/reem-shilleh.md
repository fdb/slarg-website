bio: >-
  

  Reem Shilleh lives between Brussels and Ramallah. Her practice is informed by an ongoing research on militant and revolutionary image practices specific to Palestine and its solidarity network, by examining the transational web of struggles past and present. She interlaces research, moving image, editing, archival, and writing practices to question the infinite formations of memory and collectivity, from within the conditions of the present. She is a member of Subversive Film and the Kitchen.
