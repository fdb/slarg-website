bio: >-
  Ruth Razan Loos holds a master’s of Visual Arts, a master’s in Art History and
  a PhD in the arts. She is a lecturer and post-doctoral researcher at Sint
  Lucas Antwerpen (KdG), where she also supervises several PhDs in the arts. As
  a research policy maker, she supports SLARG and develops its social outreach
  approach.


  As a member of various committees, Ruth Razan focuses on diversity and
  inclusion. She values participatory practices and a general concern for
  solidarity. For the past 5 years, she has been initiating and organising
  various events in close collaboration with Stadscanvas (Fameus), a space for
  artistic newcomers in Antwerp. Together they develop new partnerships, among
  others with the Plantin-Moretus Museum, Rataplan and Voem.


  Studying Modern Standard Arabic and volunteering as a language buddy for
  newcomers, led to a socio-political interest in our multilingual and
  multiscript world. How artists and designers critique, engage and propose a
  way of dealing with mono- and multilingual/multiscript realities is the focus
  of an elective course she teaches, and of a new Erasmus+ collaboration between
  Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG) and the American University in Cairo.


  Ruth Razan is currently completing a one-year post-doctoral research project
  "Closer than your jugular vein" at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG), which will lead
  to new initiatives where art and religion can meet.
