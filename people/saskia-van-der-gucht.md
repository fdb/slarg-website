bio: Saskia Van der Gucht (she/her) is a visual artist, artistic researcher and
  teacher based in Antwerp (BE). Her work deals with the complexities of
  emotional and economic value of housing and the feeling of home. More recently
  she is working on ecologies of extracted scarce materials such as sand.
  Through a combination of story-telling and references to jewellery and
  architecture, she translates these subjects into objects, small installations,
  writing, photography and drawings. Saskia completed several one-year research
  projects at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG) and graduated from its Advanced Master
  of Research in Arts and Design program (2023-2024).
