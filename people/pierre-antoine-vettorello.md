bio: >-
  Pierre-Antoine Vettorello is a transdisciplinary Afropean researcher-artist at
  the Antwerp Research Institute for the Arts (ARIA). His PhD project spanning
  from 2021 until 2026 is entitled "Black Yarns: Fashioning Senegalese Women's
  Resistance in the Diaspora (1939-1966)," in which his practice-based artistic
  research highlights the resistance of black women through clothing. His work
  combines writing, sculpture, crafting, and focuses on exploring how dressed
  bodies navigate between colonised and colonising spaces in colonial and
  postcolonial Paris. 


  Pierre-Antoine owns a Masters in Arts from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, and a Masters in Artistic Research from Sint Lucas Antwerpen. He participated in residencies, notably at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris and Villa Ndar in Saint-Louis. He is the author of a chapter entitled « Uniqueness in Fashion: Disrupting Modernity, Igniting Indigenous Romanticism » in the forthcoming *The Future of Fashion* *Education*. (Routledge, UK), and also a forthcoming chapter, « Dressing for Defiance: From Senegal to Diasporic Colonial Paris with Khady Diop » in *The Poetics of Fabric: Intermedial Craft in Poetry and Textiles* (Bloomsbury, UK). 


  Additionally, he edits the bilingual zine *The Yarn* deconstructing colonial violence in fashion education, museology and industry. He is also part of the inter-university research group on the transmission of craftsmanship in Flanders, "Crafting Futures".
