bio: Lieven Menschaert (º1975) is a researcher and lecturer at Sint Lucas
  Antwerp and LUCA school of arts. His primary focus lies in generative and
  computational design, where systems and algorithms play a central role in
  shaping creative outcomes. As such, he views artificial intelligence and
  machine learning not just as tools, but as a natural and logical extension of
  procedural generation—enabling more dynamic, adaptive, and intelligent design
  processes.
