  *And they don’t*

  *We can say anything*

  *But we won’t* 

  Instead of saying, she looked at me with caring determination

  She licked her thumb and pressed it on my cheek wiping the stain I didn’t even notice was there

  I thought it was icky, but felt like home

### More on TYPP

TYPP is the SLARG artistic research publication. It brings together artistic research practices, without any hierarchy or predefined format. It seeks to offer a forum for the field of artistic research, which is averse to categories and continuously reinvents and reorients itself.

TYPP #9 harbours contributions by researchers Marnie Slater, Frederik De Bleser, Helen Dowling, Ine Vanoeveren, Annelys de Vet, Lieven Menschaert, Danial Shah and Paul Hendrikse. 

TYPP #9 is designed by Ward Heirwegh.  

\--

From within the Advanced Master Share Research module, each year a new group of students produce their own *ADMA TYPP*, to open up conversation as a mode of research and practice. *ADMA TYPP #3 Your Travel Companion is designed by Joud Toamah.*
