The talk builds upon my artistic research in and on photo studios in Balochistan, Pakistan, the place where I grew up. Photographic aesthetics are a key terrain around which many individuals gather and bring individual fantasies in touch with a sense of belonging to the local community. Photographs born in these studios are not mere representations of life but tools for performing life itself, tools for becoming. In this presentation I will share the methodology of image mapping that I am presently engaged with while navigating also this terrain with the help of elements of semiotics and phenomenology. The talk focuses on the reflections interlinked to my artistic practice where I deal with questions related to addressing images from a variety of different positions: as a researcher, a photographer, documentarian, filmmaker, collector and observer let be as a former inhabitant of the geographic area in question and now a citizen in transition located in Europe
