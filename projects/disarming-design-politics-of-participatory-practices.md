In our current political and economic landscape, sustaining an emancipatory design practice—one that aligns with progressive political beliefs and social values—poses significant challenges. My practice-based research explores how political agency can be strengthened amidst these conditions by engaging in participatory design processes. 

Both the installation and dissertation extensively document three long-term, self-directed, participatory design projects: a series of books (the **Subjective Atlas series)**, a design label (**Disarming Design from Palestine**), and a master’s programme (**Disarming Design at Sandberg Instituut**). Each of these collaborative platforms originated as a counterproposal to activate design as a methodology to amplify voices, mobilise communities, and create new opportunities. Aesthetics played a crucial role in this work, shaping the sensory, material, and emotional dynamics of our spaces, the materials we engage with, and the hospitality we practise. \
\
By detailing the processes and outcomes of each of the three projects, from initiation to materialisation, and from distribution to impact, the dissertation offers an intimate and self-critical insight into the politics, tensions, and possibilities of participatory design practices. At the core is a drive to ask: How can design be liberated from the goal of finding ‘solutions’ and become a practice of agency and solidarity?
