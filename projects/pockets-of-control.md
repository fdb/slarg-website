Pockets of Control / Protection Spells is a one year research project initiated and conducted by Sander Van de Vijver.

In it, he is looking into combining programmatic approaches with classical drawing methodologies in a digital context. He is specifically interested in 3D modelling, texturing and shading, and in game design paradigms, interpreted from an illustratorâ€™s perspective.
