With this research project, I turn to activist and movement-based practices of grief work that respond to European border deaths as forms of posthumous struggle. The activists’ postmortem acts—identifying, burying, and mourning—are practices that enact care, community, accountability, and justice. These function both as commemoration and as protest, performing the posthumous reappearance of those lost to the borders while countering their enforced invisibilisation. My research asks: how can posthumous struggle serve as a lens for how illegalized people on the move resist enforced loss in their everyday lives—exile, absence, separation, and disembodiment? And how can image (drawing, film), sound, and text imagine these processes? To pursue these questions, I will explore expressive forms such as collaborative workshops with situated activists, film poems and a diary-like drawing practice. The aim is to develop a spectral imaginary of posthumous struggle. As an outcome, I intend to create a collection of expressive forms that generate an affective, sensorial, and immersive mediation of this imaginary. This collection will serve as the groundwork for a future exhibition and feature film.
