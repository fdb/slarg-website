Multidisciplinary research and archival initiative committed to investigating, documenting, and amplifying the layered histories, ecologies, political dynamics, and indigenous cultural knowledge connected to the Euphrates River in Syria. The project emerged from [](http://karachilajamia.com/)Joud Toamahâ€˜s research on infrastructural violence on the Euphrates under Assad dictatorship rule. This platform seeks to initiate collaborations along the river, and functions as an online archive to maps stories of development projects and disappearing ecologies.
