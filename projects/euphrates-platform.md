Multidisciplinary research and archival initiative committed to investigating, documenting, and amplifying layered histories, ecologies, political dynamics, and indigenous cultural knowledge connected to the Euphrates River in Syria. The project emerged from [](http://karachilajamia.com/)Joud Toamahâ€˜s research on infrastructural violence on the Euphrates under Assad dictatorship rule. This platform seeks to initiate collaborations in cross-border and along the river relations. It supports research projects and features online archives that map stories against marginalization and militarization and towards remembering ecological stewardship.
