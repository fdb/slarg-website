In 2019, I began a series of mini sketchbooks as a private space to draw around fertility, trans pregnancy, chestfeeding, medical transition, and parenthood. In this project, I explore how to translate this archive into a collection of short visual essays. I work with the spontaneity and sequential structure of the sketches, experimenting with narrative styles to make the themes accessible. Conversations with other trans and queer authors help broaden the perspective. The goal is a socially relevant, approachable collection of visual essays – a quiet form of visual activism for a world with limited space for gender variation.
