A research in progress about publishing practices (artists books, activists pamphlets, party flyers and ephemeras) with an intersectional feminist approach. 

From (micro-)typography to editorial structures. From gossip to public speech. From ghostwriting to collective pamphlets.

In this research I’m looking at objects, listening to stories, opening dusty boxes and I’m now busy documenting these treasures.
