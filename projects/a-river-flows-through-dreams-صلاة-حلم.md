Merging dream like and imaginative like with prayers I learned for fear soothing on طاسة الرعبة before drinking water. My grandmother الله يرحمها showed me from the Barzakh how faith is passed continuously like a flowing river through generations while she was sleeping in my dream.

A River Flows Through Dreams صلاة حلم is a video that explores the interconnected impacts of displacement and finds steadfastness in acts of ritual, transmission and preservation, reflecting on relationships to water, dispossession, and enduring beliefs.
