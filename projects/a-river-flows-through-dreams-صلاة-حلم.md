This research began with the *Fear Soothing Bowl*, a ritual of protection through prayers recited over water. I approached this ritual from multiple dimensions: as an object, as a protective practice, as spatial and imaginal relationality, and as a vessel of possible re-figuration connecting to the Euphrates river in Syria. How might generational practices of personal and communal protection be re-membered and sustained in conditions of war and exile?

Different reflections of this research flow through the video work *A River Flows Through Dreams صلاة حلم*. It weaves dream-like and imaginative states with prayers I learned for fear-soothing before drinking water. My grandmotherالله يرحمها showed me from the Barzakh how faith is passed continuously like a flowing river through generations while she was sleeping in my dream.

*A River Flows Through Dreams صلاة حلم* explores the interconnected impacts of displacement and finds steadfastness in acts of ritual, transmission, and preservation. It reflects on relationships to Islamic cosmology, water, and enduring beliefs.
