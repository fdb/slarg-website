**Jonathan Paepens, Jeroen Bocken, and Sander Van de Vyver** are conducting a research project that asks how students and teachers within an art academy can develop a shared sense of urgency and agency when engaging with technology, and artificial intelligence in particular.

Rather than approaching AI as a fixed or purely technical subject, the research unfolds as an open field process. Conversations with professionals, external partners, and makers are combined with collective moments such as roundtable discussions and public sessions. Together, these encounters form an evolving archive of voices, experiences, and practices that does not reduce the complexity of AI, but makes it tangible and discussable.

The project brings together discursive and artistic forms, and reflects on the position and responsibility of artists and designers at a moment when technological infrastructures increasingly shape how work is produced, circulated, and understood.
