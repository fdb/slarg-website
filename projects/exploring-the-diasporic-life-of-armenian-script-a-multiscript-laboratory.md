  This research investigates the struggles and sensitivities of working with
  underrepresented scripts, focusing on the Armenian script in the context of
  the endangered Western Armenian language. 

  With dispersed resources, unestablished typographic conventions, and limited presence in the design field, the work navigates multiple tensions: acting with urgency while resisting capitalist and colonial frameworks; preserving the script’s integrity amid evolving technologies; and questioning whether to follow, reject, or reimagine existing design pedagogies and canons.

Through intersectional, feminist, and decolonial lenses, the research seeks collaborative, participatory and creative approaches to disrupt dominant practices and reimagine both the language and the practice of design. It challenges the dominant design thinking and methodologies shaped by the Global North, where the Latin script is treated as the default and its principles assumed to be universally applicable.
My process is grounded in collective care, co-learning, and the unlearning of Western design thinking. It aims to enable and create critical space for decentralized design discourse, centered on amplifying underrepresented scripts and voices in both local and global contexts.

As a multilingual, multiscript Armenian designer in the diaspora, I collaborate with a broader multiscript design community, focusing on both the Armenian diaspora and communities in Armenia. From an embodied personal position, I collect, analyze, and organize scattered typographic knowledge—visualizing what is missing to support my practice and aiming to make these resources accessible to others.

Concretely, the work spans conceptual and material design, from creating reflective visual projects to producing tangible tools: an evolving Armenian typography guide/workbook, a glossary of relevant design terms, and revival display font(s) based on archival materials. These efforts are shaped through community feedback and remain intentionally open, resisting rigid definitions and fixed outcomes.
