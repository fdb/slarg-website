The project Story Graphics (formerly called Infografiekfabriek) aims to democratize visual storytelling and bring it within reach of smaller editorial teams. Today, creating high-quality infographics requires either limited tools or custom coding solutions. This project addresses that gap by developing open-source tools, a flexible library of components, and ready-to-use “white label” infographics that can be easily adapted to the identity of different publications. 

The project builds on [NodeBox](https://www.nodebox.net), the open-source, node-based visualization tool developed at Sint-Lucas Antwerpen. The project expands the tool and makes it easier to build infographics with features such as responsive layouts, style overrides for brand identity, and integration with a library of reusable “atoms” (basic visualization and interface elements). Our partners Tree Company contributes its expertise in long-form interactive journalism, while Eos Wetenschap ensures scientific and editorial quality. De Deeluitgeverij, finally, handles publishing, distribution, and the online “shop” where infographics and components can be accessed.

Sint Lucas contributed by developing the infographic tools that make visual storytelling flexible and intuitive. The result will be an accessible open-source environment that empowers large and small publishers, educators, and cultural partners to work with infographics in a professional and affordable way.
