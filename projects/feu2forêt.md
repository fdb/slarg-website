The Archives of the Tout-monde ﻿is an action research situated nearby the post-disciplinary visual praxis of artists, collectives and informal networks, operating on t﻿he border of the art world. Through the establishment of places of refuge, it closely examines how mainstream institutions relate to this visual praxis. A particular focus on the relational, economic and ecological core of these trembling praxis contributes to ongoing study in the (under)commons. Balancing between the sometimes counterproductive desire for visibility and the power of the invisible, boundaries trouble, artists become curators, cultural workers and curators become artists, cultural workers, making the created spaces transform into something of their own. From this shift, space for collective praxis emerge, breathing life back into the seemingly timeless still life of the visual arts from below.

O﻿ne of the main outcomes of the action research 'That Archives of the Tout-Monde' was '**FEU2FORÊT** ,bringing together a number of artists to reimagine 30 years of revolt in Brussels through different burning aesthetics.

1991, Belgium cloaked itself in a Black Sunday. After youth set fire to several suburbs of the capital, a repressed racist discourse recaptured the country. The anger lingering at the root of these revolts has never really been answered. The questions raised then, are still red hot today. Together with various Brussels artists, the exhibition ‘FEU2FORÊST’ reimagines 30 years of revolt through various burning aesthetics. 1991 is a key year in the history of Brussels. The revolts of Forest are not only followed by Black Sunday. In the same year, the first recorded soul falls victim to police brutality (#JUSTICEPOURTOUS) and the sound of Brussels hip-hop breaks through to the general public, with the album Bruxelles Rap Convention. By working around the forgotten  smoldering fire of 1991, we hope to strengthen the visibility of the sparks that flew off various Brussels neighborhoods, to confront the challenges we apparently still face today.
