abstract: The PhD research explores at broad formats of communal life that are
  based on care and mutual aid. In particular it is grounded in the artistic
  practice of co-initiation and co-maintenance of housing projects for and with
  people who are in financial and legal precarity (the homeless, sans-papiers,
  asylum seekers). The research explores through practice how care can be
  extended from the private nuclear family towards a broader group of people in
  need through sharing living space. In line with art as social practice the
  research explores ways of sharing space by overcoming established formats and
  proposing alternatives. The question of ethics is at the core of the research.
  Offering care to someone in a particular need involves inequality in power,
  which can lead to abuse, by fostering dis-empowerment and dependency. This
  research explores formats of care that are acknowledging potential pitfalls of
  inequality and offers practical proposals based on mutual aid, allyship and
  love.
