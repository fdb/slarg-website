The research project wants to explore whether the representation of a contemporary (geological/urban) landscape can be enhanced through the use of the material aluminum. In addition to concrete and plastic, it is a symbolic material for the current Anthropocene era, a so-called technofossil. The research aims to discover whether a social layer can be added.
Drawing and/or painting takes place with and/or on various aluminium carriers, challenging innovative spatial approaches and interactions. The characteristic properties of the improper material in relation to an (urban) landscape are investigated. By using formal means - such as the grid, folds, a window - the crumbling landscape is given a new framework. Reflective surfaces are added to this research project: the in situ experience is (re)quested, and new meanings are generated for the concept of time.


In addition to the creation of artistic work with new parameters specific for the qualities of the material aluminum, there will be a reflective part. For this I want to explore (further) the possibilities of a visual essay in which (spoken) word and image interact with each other and together articulate the discursive dimension of this project. The visual output becomes visible through this medium and via the realization of an exhibition of the artistic experiments.
