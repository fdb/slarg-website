Robin Vanbesien successfully defended his artistic doctoral study, *Ciné Place-Making* (2018–2024). The research traced cinematic approaches to place-making within grassroots initiatives, networks, and social movements that resist oppressive spaces shaped by colonial racial capitalism.

Vanbesien investigated how cinema can emerge as a collaborative practice that foregrounds connection, collective desire, and situated imaginaries, rather than reinforcing dominant meanings. He proposed *ciné place-making* as a method to rehearse social assemblies, reclaim collective intensity, and envision more livable futures.

The study encompassed three artistic projects—*the wasp and the weather* (2018–2020), *ciné assemblies* with The Post Film Collective (2020–2023), and *Holding Rehearsals* (2021–2024)—resulting in films and video-installations, as well as workshops, performances, study circles, assemblies, and archival practices that extended the work beyond the screen.
