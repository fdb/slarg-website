abstract: This project explores how independent filmmakers in Vietnam since the
  early 2000s have navigated state censorship, situating their practices within
  a historical continuum from the colonial era to the present and linking them
  to wider negotiations between cinema, power, and cultural politics in
  authoritarian contexts today.

This project investigates the dynamics of film censorship and the negotiation of independent cinema in Vietnam since the early 2000s. It takes a threefold approach. First, it traces the history of censorship in Vietnam from the colonial period to the present, situating these practices in dialogue not only with Southeast Asian counterparts but also with Chinese and Indian trajectories, where cinema has long been entangled with state power, morality, and cultural politics. Second, it examines how Vietnamese filmmakers, especially those working independently, have navigated censorship in the changing landscape of neo-liberal authoritarianism, where economic reforms have unfolded alongside political restrictions. Third, the project focuses on a single filmmaker, analyzing how censorship intersects with their artistic choices, production practices, and strategies of circulation. By combining historical research, regional and trans-Asian comparison, and close analysis of contemporary practices, the project seeks to shed light on the broader negotiations between cinema, censorship, and cultural politics that continue to shape artistic expression in authoritarian societies today.
