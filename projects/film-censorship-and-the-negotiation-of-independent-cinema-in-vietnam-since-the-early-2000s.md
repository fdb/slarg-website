This artistic research explores how Vietnamese radical audio-visual artists have encountered and transcended both overt and latent forms of censorship imposed by the state, society, and the artists themselves. Through an arts-based methodology grounded in film practice, the project mobilizes archival fragments and found footage as a critical and aesthetic strategy. Positioned at the intersection of historical inquiry and artistic experimentation, the project adopts a threefold lens: (1) mapping the continuities and ruptures between French colonial censorship and its present manifestations in Vietnam; (2) examining how independent filmmakers negotiate artistic freedom within the contradictions of neo-liberal authoritarianism; and (3) conducting an auto-ethnographic engagement with one filmmaker’s practice, mapping the entanglements of censorship with artistic choices, production conditions, and strategies of circulation. By combining historical research with an embodied, practice-led approach, this research reimagines cinema not merely as a medium of representation but as an artistic methodology for resisting, surviving, and reconfiguring censorship in authoritarian societies.
