  audio-visual artists navigate and transform censorship through an arts-based
  film practice that combines archival experimentation, historical inquiry, and

This artistic research queers censorship by investigating how Vietnamese radical audio-visual artists transcend both overt and latent forms of control imposed by the state, society, and the artists themselves. In this context, to *queer* censorship is to twist, subvert, and navigate its mechanisms in order to expose, resist, and reconfigure their power.

Grounded in an arts-based methodology of experimental film practice, the project mobilizes archival fragments and found footage as critical and aesthetic strategies for unsettling dominant narratives. Positioned at the intersection of historical inquiry and artistic experimentation, it unfolds through three lenses: (1) uncovering how the legacy of French colonial censorship reverberates within contemporary mechanisms of control; (2) examining how independent filmmakers negotiate artistic freedom within the contradictions of neo-liberal authoritarianism; and (3) conducting an auto-ethnographic investigation of one filmmaker’s practice to map the entanglements of censorship with artistic choices, production conditions, and circulation strategies.

By weaving historical research with embodied, practice-led methods, this research reimagines cinema not merely as a medium of representation but as an experimental methodology for resisting, surviving, and reconfiguring censorship in authoritarian societies.
