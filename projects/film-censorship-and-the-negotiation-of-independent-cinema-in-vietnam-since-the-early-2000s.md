abstract: This project explores how independent filmmakers in Vietnam since the
  early 2000s have navigated state censorship, situating their practices within
  a historical continuum from the colonial era to the present and linking them
  to wider negotiations between cinema, power, and cultural politics in
  authoritarian contexts today.

This artistic research explores how Vietnamese radical audio-visual artists have encountered and transcended both overt and latent forms of censorship imposed by the state, society, and the artists themselves. Through an arts-based methodology grounded in film practice, the project mobilizes archival fragments and found footage as a critical and aesthetic strategy. Positioned at the intersection of historical inquiry and artistic experimentation, the project adopts a threefold lens: (1) tracing the genealogy of censorship in Vietnam in regional and transnational contexts; (2) examining how independent filmmakers negotiate artistic freedom within the contradictions of neo-liberal authoritarianism; and (3) conducting an auto-ethnographic engagement with one filmmaker’s practice, mapping the entanglements of censorship with artistic choices, production conditions, and strategies of circulation. By combining historical research with an embodied, practice-led approach, this research reimagines cinema not merely as a medium of representation but as an artistic methodology for resisting, surviving, and reconfiguring censorship in authoritarian societies.
