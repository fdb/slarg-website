Situated in the Kitchen, a space dedicated to collective practices and study, (re:Sol) proposes to work on sensible forms of memorial restitution through the re-distribution of various radio programs and self-published magazines produced by the Maghrebi community during the 1970s and ’80s in Brussels. Collaborating and working nearby protagonists and witnesses of that period, it engages in possible forms of sonic and visual re-imagination, and re-distribution of forms of solidarity engrained in the collected traces. Weaving printing and sonic practices,  it aspires to contribute to the ongoing conversations in artistic research on collective forms of imagination, memory and solidarity work.
