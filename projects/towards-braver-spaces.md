In the last few years, especially after the Summer of 2020, the idea of safe and safer spaces have become part of what many of us try and create in and out of institutions. But what are Braver Spaces, what are the best ways to aspire towards them and eventually create them? Since the beginning of 2021 a small initiative started by some young, marginalized people and two lecturers, has aspired to answer this question. This has been done through weekly meetings, healing spaces, Supper Clubs and a Summer School. Understanding, the work is never done, and that a Braver Spaces is always evolving and might not be able to assure safety and in turn present the ability for all at the same time, to feel brave enough to express themselves.
