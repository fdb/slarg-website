Hybrid research work centered on the Euphrates river and the suspended bridge as living witnesses. During the Assad regime’s assaults and siege on Deir ez-Zor, the Euphrates river was among the first to be targeted. Bridges connecting its banks were destroyed. The suspension bridge, once a symbol of post-French colonization, was shelled, leaving only its three columns standing, suspended in midair. The 7 bridges of the city has seen similar violence, who controlled water and crossing points controlled movement. Through the research, I explore layers of political, personal, architectural and ecological memory, through fragments of water prayers, Euphratean poetry, local mythologies, an attempt of (non)crossing to (no)return. 

Another project came out of this work - The Euphrates Research platform. A multidisciplinary research and archival project committed to investigating and documenting layered histories, ecologies and necropolitics along the Euphrates in Syria, as well as amplifying local knowledge. This platform seeks to initiate collaborations in cross-border and along the river relations. It supports research projects and brings together a network of online archives, projects and people dedicated to tell stories against marginalization and militarization and towards remembering ecological stewardship.
