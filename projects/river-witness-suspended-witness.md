Hybrid video work centered on the Euphrates river and the suspended bridge as living witnesses. During the Assad regimeâ€™s assaults and siege on Deir ez-Zor, the Euphrates river was among the first to be targeted. Bridges connecting its banks were destroyed. The suspension bridge, once a symbol of post-French colonization, was shelled, leaving only its three columns standing, suspended in midair. The 7 bridges of the city has seen similar violence, who controlled water and crossing points controlled movement. Through the film, I explore layers of political, personal, architectural and ecological memory, a (non)crossing to (no)return.
