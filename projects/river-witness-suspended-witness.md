Hybrid video work centered on the Euphrates river and the suspended bridge as living witnesses. During the Assad regimeâ€™s assaults and siege on Deir ez-Zor, the Euphrates river was among the first to be targeted. Bridges connecting its banks were destroyed. The suspension bridge, once a symbol of post-French colonization, was shelled, leaving only its three columns standing, suspended in midair. The 7 bridges of the city has seen similar violence, who controlled water and crossing points controlled movement. Through the film, I explore layers of political, personal, architectural and ecological memory, through fragments of fear soothing water prayers and laments, a (non)crossing to (no)return. 

Another project came out of this work - The Euphrates Research platform. A multidisciplinary research and archival project committed to investigating, documenting, amplifying and sharing layered histories, ecologies, political dynamics, and indigenous cultural knowledge connected to the Euphrates River in Syria. The project emerged from my research on infrastructural violence on the Euphrates under Assad dictatorship rule and the difficulty and isolation I experienced in the researching process. This platform seeks to initiate collaborations in cross-border and along the river relations. It supports research projects and brings together a network of online archives, research and people dedicated to tell stories against marginalization and militarization and towards remembering ecological stewardship.
