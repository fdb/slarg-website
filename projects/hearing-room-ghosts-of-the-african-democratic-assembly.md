How narratives of anti-colonial struggles, forms of fugitivity and resistance from the Carribean, Americas, African former colonised countries reflect each other in ways that span historical and geographical distances? What do they have in common? How can we conceptualize specific and peculiar experiences of resistance as part of broader social, political, revolutionary, and/or redemptive movements, taking into account their inner complexities? On the basis of which concepts can we consider the dynamic that makes them circulate, disperse and converge as a movement?   

Afro-diasporic and Black radical thoughts, critical, postcolonial, and decolonial theories have provided conceptual tools with which to reflect on these questions. Among them was and still is «Blackness» as a notion to think about what grounds their communality, whether conceived as based on a collective consciousness and/or postmemory of the experience of slavery, colonization, displacement and racism; a transnational space of exchange, circulation, and belonging that connects cultures from across the Atlantic; an historic stigma constituted within the modernity and by the racist white gaze; or emerging from a shared precolonial civilizational root matrix; or as an ontological totality born of the collective negrophobic unconscious,... Perspectives on «blackness» are multiple and they often diverge within the discourse.  

Considering these divergences and dissensus as constituve of a fertile ground, my research project attempts to reveal the multiplicity and ambivalency of forces that move through and structure imaginations of Blackness. By starting from a very specific historical situation of anti-colonial resistance in the old french west african colonies, I’ve tried to explore other stories of resistance to make them collide into narrative and speculative fictions.
