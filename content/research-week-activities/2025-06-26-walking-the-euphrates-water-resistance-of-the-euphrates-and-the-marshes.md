Walking the Euphrates is a shared dialogue between researchers Joud Toamah and Ameneh Solati on the Euphrates in Syria and the marshes in Iraq as living, ecological and geopolitical bodies. Through this shared walk along the river, the researchers will trace shared contexts along the aquatic geographies of the river and the marshes, shared resistance, struggle, and care, focusing on the waters as companions and ancestor.
