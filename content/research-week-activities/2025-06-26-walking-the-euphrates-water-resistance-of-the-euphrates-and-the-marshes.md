*Walking the Euphrates* is a shared dialogue between artist-researchers **Joud Toamah** and **Ameneh Solati**, exploring the Euphrates river in Syria and the marshes in Iraq as living, ecological, and geopolitical bodies of resistance. Through this collective ‘walk’ along the river, they trace entangled aquatic geographies, histories of struggle and care, and shared contexts of resistance, centering the waters as companions and ancestral presences. This will take the form of hybrid ways to share research through artist talks, sound and video. 

**Joud Toamah** is a multidisciplinary graphic designer and artist-researcher from Syria, currently based in Belgium. Working across multiple media, publishing, writing, video, sound, and image-making, her practice engages displacement and re-memberance within personal and collective memory. Currently She is undergoing an artistic research that centers water cultures, and water as a site of witness and resistance amid militarization and infrastructural violence during and in post-dictatorship Syria along the watery places she loves by the Euphrates. She is currently coordinating the Advanced Master of Art and Design Research (AdMa), and co-preparing a course on ‘Islamic Ways of Knowing and Aesthetic Practices’ at Sint Lucas Antwerp.

**Ameneh Solati** is a Rotterdam-based researcher, architect, editor, and educator. Her practice engages with interdisciplinary methods and explores subjects such as domesticity, displacement, environmental violence, geopolitics, and trauma inheritance. Solati seeks alternative lenses and sources of knowledge within often overlooked spaces and devices. She completed her MA degree in Architecture in 2017 at the Royal College of Art in London. Solati is the 2021 recipient of the Talent Development Grant by Creative Industries NL. She is currently an editor and organiser at Failed Architecture, and a lecturer at Gerrit Rietveld Academy.
