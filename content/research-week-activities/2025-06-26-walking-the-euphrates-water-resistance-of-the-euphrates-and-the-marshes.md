*Walking the Euphrates* is a shared dialogue between SLARG researcher **Joud Toamah** and invited guest **Ameneh Solati**. Together, they explore the Euphrates in Syria and the marshes in Iraq as living, ecological, and geopolitical bodies of resistance. Through this collective “walk” along the river, they trace entangled aquatic geographies, histories of struggle and care, and contexts of resistance: centering water as a companion and ancestral presence. 

Joud Toamah is an artist-researcher whose practice engages with water cultures and the Euphrates as a site of witness and resistance. She currently develops the research project *River Witness*, from which this session emerges.

Ameneh Solati is a research-based artist and architect whose work investigates spatial forms of power and resistance in marginalised contexts. She teaches at the Design Academy Eindhoven and is editor-at-large at *Failed Architecture*. Her projects include *Wetlands of Resistance* (e-flux Architecture, 2023), and her work has been presented at institutions such as Stroom Den Haag, Stedelijk Museum Schiedam, and the Venice Architecture Biennale.

This session combines conversation, sound, and video to open up shared reflections on rivers, resistance, and memory.
