As part of our annual Research Week, we are hosting a focused mini-symposium on **“The Political Implications of AI.”**

The event will be structured around short presentations (20 minutes each) followed by an extended discussion with the audience. Contributions will come from **Olya Kudina**, **Freya van den Boom**, **Joanna Zylinska** (tbc), and a **queer–trans collective offering an experimental workshop**.

Together we will ask:

* How do AI systems redistribute agency, visibility, and power?
* In what ways do AI-driven image production and generative models invite us to rethink creativity, perception, and authorship?
* What kinds of ethical and political futures are opened—or foreclosed—through algorithmic technologies?

For **artistic researchers, students, and others working at the intersection of art, politics, and technology**, this symposium provides a space to critically reflect on how AI entangles with human and non-human forms of understanding, and to explore how creative practices can respond to or resist its influence.

Join us in thinking through AI not only as a technical tool, but as a political and cultural force that reshapes our ways of seeing, knowing, and imagining.

*The image was generated with AI: an algorithmic imagination of togetherness, inviting us to reflect on its political and ethical implications.*
