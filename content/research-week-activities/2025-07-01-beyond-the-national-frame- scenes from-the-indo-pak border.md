In conjunction with the exhibition opening and PhD defense of SLARG researcherDanial Shah, we are pleased to welcome **Natasha Raheja** (Cornell University) for a talk and screening. 

In this talk, Raheja presents her use of formal filmic techniques to advance a visual argument about mobility and borders in South Asia. While borders are often made visible through familiar representations—maps, fences, walls, passports, and news coverage—her work asks what happens when the narrative is shuffled. By splicing, juxtaposing, and recombining images of borders, Raheja disrupts figurative absorption and shows how the India–Pakistan border is not only a site of division but also a continuous space of encounter.

Drawing on long-term ethnographic fieldwork in the Thar Desert region, she will screen and discuss two works:

* **A Gregarious Species** (2023, 9 min): An experimental found-footage film that weaves together mobile phone videos of transboundary locust swarms, political rallies, and scientific webinars. The film highlights the selective porosity of borders amidst environmental crisis, farmer insecurity, and rising nationalism in South Asia.
* **Kitne Passports?** (in production, 15 min sample): A work-in-progress that follows four cross-caste Pakistani Hindu migrant families as they shift between minority and majority status, navigating uncertain futures in India.

Through montage, glitch, and split-screen techniques, Raheja explores how visual media itself can unsettle fixed imaginaries of the border, revealing both its ruptures and continuities.
