Join us for a full day exploration of artistic expressions rooted in Islamic knowledges. This session is curated by SLARG researchers **Ruth R. Loos** and **Joud Toamah**.

Open for all, we look forward to welcoming you.

### *Lecture-performance* 

**Murmurations and Migrations: Learning from the Avian Wisdom of Farid al-Din Attar.** Birds are bird-brained. This does not mean they are stupid! No, they think Other-wise, much as humans from other times and other places. This lecture-performance uses the philosophy embedded in the Persian epic poem *The Conference of the Birds* (1177 CE) by Farid al-Din Attar as a means of rethinking the dialectics of belonging and migration in the contemporary world towards a framework of collective action, mutual engagement, and transcendance. 

**Wendy Miriam Kural Shaw** (PhD 1999, University of California, Los Angeles) describes herself as gleefully deinstitutionalized and imaginatively undisciplined. She served as professor in departments of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, Media Studies, and Art History in the United States, Turkey, Switzerland and Germany. Her initial interest in the transcultural recycling of art and its institutions under paradigms of Westernization and secularization in modern Turkey developed into an examination of Islamic discourses of perception as a source for decolonized expression. Liberated from the disciplinary mandate of universities since the end of her position as Professor of Islamic Art at the Free University Berlin in 2021, she continues to explore the interface between culture and religion. She is author of *Possessors and Possessed: Museums, Archaeology, and the Visualization of History in the Late Ottoman Empire* (University of California Press, 2003), *Ottoman Painting: Reflections of Western Art from the Ottoman Empire to the Turkish Republic* (IB Tauris, 2011). *What is “Islamic” Art: Between Religion and Perception* (Cambridge University Press, 2019, Honorable Mention for the 2020 Albert Hourani Book Award of the Middle East Studies Association and the 2021 Iran Book Award), and *Loving Writing: Techniques for the University and Beyond* (Routledge, 2021). She currently writes and illustrates short and long footnoted fiction and verse.

### *Live Perso-Arabic Calligraphy*

Experience the elegance and precision of Islamic calligraphy with **Tamim SahibZada**, master calligrapher, miniaturist, and book illuminator. Tamim refined his craft under masters such as Taheri (Kabul) and Mohammad Amin (Peshawar) and was among the first lecturers and student mentors at the Turquoise Mountain Institute. There, he developed the curriculum for miniature art, book illustration, colour design, tapestry, and geometric and Islamic design. His live demonstrations bring these centuries-old traditions vividly into the present.

### *Devotional Performance*

Witness a living archive of sacred sound and practice with the **Kairo Girls’ School**, a collective of women dedicated to preserving Indigenous and oral traditions of Islamic knowledge, storytelling, and traditional crafts. Their performances are guided by the principle of *improvisistance*—a concept coined by Dirar Kalash, blending improvisation and resistance to remain truthfully present. Through voice, electronic synth, natural acoustics, and sacred sounds, they build a dynamic practice of *dhikr* and remembrance, extending their invitation to all who seek it.

### *Screening of* *Four Acts of Recovery*

Join us for the screening of *Four Acts of Recovery*, a video installation that follows a family of fisherfolk displaced from their ancestral home of Mul Creek in the fabled Indus Delta, following unprecedented environmental collapse caused by dams and large water infrastructures. Unlike the colonial approach of drawing maps to fix and control, the community practice of painting landscapes is a sacred ritual for seeking reconnection. It draws on the ancient tradition of drawing talismans in Islamic culture, offering protection and breathing life into a world under threat. 

**Shahana Rajani** is an interdisciplinary artist exploring themes of development, militarization, and ecological disruption in Pakistan through visual representation, landscapes, and infrastructure. Her practice is rooted in community-based collaborative research, engaging with histories of dissent and representations that sustain ecological resistance.
