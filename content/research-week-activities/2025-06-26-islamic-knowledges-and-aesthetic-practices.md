As part of SLARG’s Research Week, this full-day programme brings together artistic practices, scholarship, and community-based engagement informed by Islamic knowledges. **Ruth R. Loos** and **Joud Toamah**, SLARG researchers, have collaborated to design a programme that highlights intersections of migration, belonging, care, and ecological and cultural resilience through multiple creative formats. Open to all, the day combines lectures, performances, live demonstrations, and screenings.

### **Programme**

**Lecture-Performance**\
**Murmurations and Migrations: Learning from the Avian Wisdom of Farid al-Din Attar**\
Through the lens of Farid al-Din Attar’s 12th-century Persian epic poem *The Conference of the Birds*, this lecture-performance rethinks migration, belonging, and collective action in the contemporary world. Using poetic and philosophical frameworks, participants are invited to consider the dialectics of engagement, care, and transcendence in both human and nonhuman communities.

*Led by Wendy Miriam Kural Shaw, Assistant Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures at the University of California, Los Angeles. Wendy’s research spans Islamic visual culture, transcultural artistic practices, and decolonized approaches to perception and representation. Her work bridges art history, media studies, and anthropology, exploring how historical and contemporary Islamic discourses can inform creative practice today.*

**Live Perso-Arabic Calligraphy**\
Experience centuries-old traditions of Islamic calligraphy with **Tamim SahibZada**, master calligrapher, miniaturist, and book illuminator. Tamim brings his practice to life with live demonstrations, highlighting miniature art, book illustration, and geometric design.

**Devotional Performance**\
The **Kairo Girls’ School**, a women-led collective preserving Indigenous and oral Islamic traditions, offers a live performance guided by *improvisistance*—a practice combining improvisation and resistance to remain fully present. Using voice, electronics, and natural acoustics, they engage audiences in a living archive of sacred sound and remembrance.

**Screening**\
**Shahana Rajani** presents *Four Acts of Recovery*, a video installation following a displaced fisherfolk family from Mul Creek in the Indus Delta. Combining environmental, cultural, and spiritual perspectives, the work highlights sacred landscape practices and community rituals that reconnect people to their threatened environments. Shahana is an interdisciplinary artist and researcher exploring ecological and social practices in Pakistan through visual representation, landscapes, and infrastructure, often working in community-based collaborative contexts.

**Throughout the day**\
A table with books and zines will be available for viewing, connecting the ideas and practices presented in the sessions to printed and visual media.
