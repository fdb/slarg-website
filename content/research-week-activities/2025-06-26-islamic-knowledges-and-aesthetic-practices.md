Join us for a full day exploration of faith, perception, and artistic expression in Islamic arts, guided by scholars and artists whose work bridges historical knowledge and contemporary practice. This session is curated by SLARG researchers **Ruth R. Loos** and **Joud Toamah**, who bring together perspectives on how religion, art, and cultural memory intersect.

### *K﻿eynote Wendy M.K. Shaw*

**Shaw**, a leading scholar of Islamic art history, has made significant contributions to the discourse on the relationship between religion, perception, and artistic creation. Her book, *What is 'Islamic' Art?: Between Religion and Perception*, offers a groundbreaking approach by examining Islamic arts through the lens of historical Islam’s discursive sphere—including the Qur’an, Hadith, Sufism, ancient philosophy, and poetry. By prioritising the experience of reception over the context of production, Shaw challenges prevailing narratives in Islamic art while advocating for a decolonising model for global art history practices.

### *Live Perso-Arabic Calligraphy*

Experience the elegance and precision of Islamic calligraphy with **Tamim SahibZada**, master calligrapher, miniaturist, and book illuminator. Tamim refined his craft under masters such as Taheri (Kabul) and Mohammad Amin (Peshawar) and was among the first lecturers and student mentors at the Turquoise Mountain Institute. There, he developed the curriculum for miniature art, book illustration, colour design, tapestry, and geometric and Islamic design. His live demonstrations bring these centuries-old traditions vividly into the present.

### *Devotional Performance*

Witness a living archive of sacred sound and practice with the **Kairo Girls’ School**, a collective of women dedicated to preserving Indigenous and oral traditions of Islamic knowledge, storytelling, and traditional crafts. Their performances are guided by the principle of *improvisistance*—a concept coined by Dirar Kalash, blending improvisation and resistance to remain truthfully present. Through voice, electronic synth, natural acoustics, and sacred sounds, they build a dynamic practice of *dhikr* and remembrance, extending their invitation to all who seek it.

### *Screening of* *Four Acts of Recovery*

**Shahana Rajani** is an interdisciplinary artist exploring themes of development, militarization, and ecological disruption in Pakistan through visual representation, landscapes, and infrastructure. Her practice is rooted in community-based collaborative research, engaging with histories of dissent and representations that sustain ecological resistance. 

Join us for the screening of *Four Acts of Recovery*, a video installation that follows a family of fisherfolk displaced from their ancestral home of Mul Creek in the fabled Indus Delta, following unprecedented environmental collapse caused by dams and large water infrastructures. Unlike the colonial approach of drawing maps to fix and control, the community practice of painting landscapes is a sacred ritual for seeking reconnection. It draws on the ancient tradition of drawing talismans in Islamic culture, offering protection and breathing life into a world under threat.
