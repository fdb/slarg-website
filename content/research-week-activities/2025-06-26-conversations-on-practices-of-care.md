This symposium opens a conversation on citizen-organised support structures for undocumented people and refugees in Brussels. We turn our attention to the individuals and collectives who extend care beyond their own families and intimate circles to “strangers”: people they have never met, who often arrive from other countries, cultures, and religions, and who live under conditions of heightened precarity. At stake are questions of hospitality and care. 

* What forms of citizen-led mutual aid exist in Brussels?
* What motivates people to offer support?
* What challenges and ethical questions arise in this work?

The symposium is initiated by community artist and researcher **Dimitri van den Wittenboer**, whose doctoral project *Empowered Care* explores housing initiatives created with people facing acute legal and financial insecurity. His practice investigates how care can be woven into daily life by sharing living space, and how ethics, solidarity, and vulnerability are negotiated in such settings.

Community practice, as Dimitri frames it, is a field where activism, social work, and art converge and cross-pollinate. Questions of ethics lie at the core of this work. They are especially pressing in the context of widening global inequality, (forced) migration, and state violence.

How might we live—together—in an unfair world?\
Can we move beyond charity towards forms of mutuality, allyship, and shared struggle?

This symposium invites those who share these questions, or who wish to inform their own practice with mutual aid and care ethics. We will begin with moderated prompts and then open into a communal discussion.
