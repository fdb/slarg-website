Practice-based research is conducted across diverse creative disciplines, including visual arts, performance, design, sound, and interdisciplinary practices. In this session we will explore how experimental, artistic, and knowledge-producing processes inform research outcomes? We will look into several research practices, with a particular focus on the role of creative processes and the challenges they entail.

This closed session is intended for MA students from the Sint Lucas Antwerpen *Autonomous Context* and aims to foster critical reflection on research through artistic practice.

Organised by tutors/researchers: Helen Mauli Dowling, Saddie Choua, Kim Gorus and Wesley Meuris.
