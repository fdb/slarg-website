In this session, we will explore how creative processes contribute to the potential outcomes of artistic practices. Practice-based research is conducted across diverse creative disciplines, including visual arts, performance, design, sound, and interdisciplinary practices. How do experimental, artistic, and knowledge-producing processes inform research outcomes? We will look into several research practices, with a particular focus on the role of creative processes and the challenges they entail.

This internal session, part of Research Week, is specifically intended for MA students in the *Autonomous Context* and aims to foster critical reflection on research through artistic practice.
