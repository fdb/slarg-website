Kitchen Broadcast is an ongoing online conversation, listening to different voices, rhythms and sounds that reflect present situations in Brussels. For slarg research week, Kitchen Broadcast airs the second part of a live programme, drawing from a series of closed listening sessions amongst friends, introducing excerpts from Radio El Wafa (The Trustworthy) and Sawt al Muhajir (The Voice of the Migrant), two radios founded in Brussels in the 1980s when there was an explosion of pirate radios in the city. The live broadcast will explore possible ways to re-distribute solidarities activated among the then still free radio stations. These sessions are part of the research project re:Sol, by Joachim Ben Yakoub and Reem Shilleh.
