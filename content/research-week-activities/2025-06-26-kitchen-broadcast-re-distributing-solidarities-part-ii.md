SLARG researchers, **Joachim Ben Yakoub** and **Reem Shilleh** present the second part of Kitchen Broadcast, an ongoing online conversation that listens to different voices, rhythms, and sounds reflecting present-day Brussels.

Building on a series of closed listening sessions among friends, this live programme introduces excerpts from Radio El Wafa (The Trustworthy) and Sawt al Muhajir (The Voice of the Migrant), two radios founded in Brussels in the 1980s during the cityâ€™s explosion of pirate radio stations. The broadcast explores ways to re-distribute solidarities activated by these early, still-independent radio initiatives, connecting historical practices of community radio with contemporary reflections on collective care and activism.

This session is part of the research project re:Sol, developed by Joachim Ben Yakoub and Reem Shilleh.
