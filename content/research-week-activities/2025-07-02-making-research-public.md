M﻿aking your artistic research process public is what is expected from researchers, but it is not always an easy task. It is less straightforward than sharing your artistic outcomes, it asks for a careful deliberation about what medium is best fitted, and it poses multiple questions about translation and accessibility.

I﻿n this session some researchers in the arts with share with you the tools they use to share their artistic research process; you will learn about their advantages and challenges and there will be ample time to ask questions. We will dive into several ways of sharing: making zines, books, websites, using the SAR research catalogue, or writing academic papers and attending conferences. The options are plenty, the challenge is to find what fits best with your research process. Come, share and learn!
