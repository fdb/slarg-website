A﻿s part of his PhD trajectory, **Viet Phu Pham** will give a lecture on film censorship in Vietnam, drawing on an auto-ethnographic approach. Viet will relate the Vietnamese context to global perspectives, reflecting on how cinema is silenced across different histories and contemporary debates. 

E﻿verybody is welcome - also most fitting for (film) students.
