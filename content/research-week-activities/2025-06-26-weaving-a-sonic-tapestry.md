For the evening program of the SLARG Research Week, the Kitchen proposes a live sonic tapestry, weaving fragments from Radio El Wafa  and Sawt al Muhajir, two pirate radios that emerged in Brussels during the 1980s —a time when the city’s airwaves were proliferating with rogue frequencies. The handed down radio tapes will be woven back into a sonic tapestry, exploring how the solidarities engrained in the practice of these once-free stations can resonate today. Through this process of interlacing, their transmissions are subjected to sonic diffraction: past fragments are recomposed in the present, not as faithful representations or reproductions but as resonant interferences, where past and potential solidarities collide. 

The live sonic tapestry is part of the research project re:Sol, by Joachim Ben Yakoub and Reem Shilleh.
