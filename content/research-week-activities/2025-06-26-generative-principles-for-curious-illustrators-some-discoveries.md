**Sander Van de Vyver**, illustrator and SLARG researcher, presents a round-up of the **[Pockets of Control](https://slarg.be/projects/pockets-of-control/)** research project.

This presentation explores roadside discoveries and procedural practices, offering a reflection on how systems—both visible and hidden—structure our everyday interactions. Described as a “love letter” to double scattering, decoupled systems, and pixel shaders, the talk combines broad conceptual ideas with anecdotal insights, making it accessible for a general audience.
