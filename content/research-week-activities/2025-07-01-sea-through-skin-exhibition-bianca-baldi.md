PhD researcher **Bianca Baldi** (SLARG/ARIA) will guide a tour of her solo exhibition *Sea Through Skin* at Kunsthal Extra City. We warmly invite you to join.

The exhibition takes as its starting point the phenomenon of racial passing, tracing how proximity to whiteness and colonial histories of visibility shape the way we seeâ€”and are seen. Through film, textiles, glass, photography, and installation, Baldi reflects on identity as something fluid rather than fixed, drawing on personal histories, collective memory, and the ocean as a metaphor of depth and resistance.

Curated by Joachim Naudts and Darly Benneker, this exhibition marks the culmination of Baldiâ€™s doctoral project *Play-White: Racial Passing and Embodied Images* at Sint Lucas Antwerpen and ARIA (UA).
