**Danial Shah**, PhD researcher (SLARG/ARIA), warmly invites you to the opening of his exhibition *Visions of Becoming and Belonging* at FOMU – Fotomuseum Antwerpen.

Rooted in his PhD research, Shah’s exhibition delves into the vibrant world of photo studios in his hometown of Quetta, Pakistan. Once defined by hand-painted backdrops, costumes, and tangible props, these studios have transformed into digital collage playgrounds. Yet their core purpose remains: spaces where identities, aspirations, and a sense of belonging are imagined, constructed, and reworked.

Through photography and film, Shah captures how people use these studios to project themselves into imagined realities, navigating personal dreams and social dynamics. His work offers a fascinating glimpse into the interplay between memory, identity, and creative self-fashioning.
