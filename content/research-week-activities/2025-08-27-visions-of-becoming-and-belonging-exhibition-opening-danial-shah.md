Danial Shah, PhD researcher at SLARG, warmly invites you to the opening of his exhibition ***Visions of Becoming and Belonging*** at **FOMU - the museum of photography in Antwerp**, coinciding with his PhD defense the following day, **Friday, 24th**.

Rooted in his ongoing research at Sint Lucas Antwerpen and the University of Antwerp (coordinated by ARIA | Antwerp Research Institute for the Arts), Shah’s exhibition delves into the vibrant world of photo studios in his hometown of **Quetta, Pakistan**. Once defined by hand-painted backdrops, costumes, and tangible props, these studios have transformed into digital collage playgrounds. Yet their core purpose remains: spaces where identities, aspirations, and a sense of belonging are imagined, constructed, and reworked.

Through photography and film, Shah captures how people use these studios to project themselves into imagined realities, navigating personal dreams and social dynamics. His work offers a fascinating glimpse into the interplay between memory, identity, and creative self-fashioning.
