**The Spring Pears** are a geographically dispersed collective that emerged from the Advanced Master year 2023–24 at Sint Lucas Antwerpen, consisting of An-Marie Breem, Yi Zhang, Katy Drake, Anthe Hermans, Saskia Van der Gucht and Kristí Fekete.\
\
Over six months in 2025, we conducted an experimental artistic research project, exchanging our work through post packages. Each round responded to the previously received package, guided by six themes that run through our individual practices. 

This fall, we will come together for a four-day residency to transform these ongoing exchanges into a printed publication. The project reflects not only our artistic processes but also our inability to systematically choose between priority stamps or tracking, and the tangible outcomes of this collaborative experiment.

On Monday 20 October, we invite you to share in the culmination of this project. This event will present the completed publication, the artworks created, and our experiences and methodologies from our first collective endeavour.

The session, *A Care-full Debriefing*, draws its name from our shared interest in the ethics of care: a commitment to valuing relationships over results and recognising the work that care itself requires.

We welcome collectives and individuals interested in collaborative, care-focused art practices and self-organised publishing. Join us to explore our process, exchange insights, and engage in a conversation about the challenges and highlights of collective making.

Copies of the printed publication will be available for exchange with other publications.\

Let us know via **[springpears@tutamail.com](mailto:springpears@tutamail.com)** if you care to join us, so we can estimate the amount of space and chairs we need.
