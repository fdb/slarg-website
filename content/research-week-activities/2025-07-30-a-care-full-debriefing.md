14:00–17:00 – A Care-full Debriefing – with the Spring Pears Collective (Library)\
\
\
The Spring Pears are a geographically disparate collective that evolved from the Advanced Master year ‘23-’24 at Sint Lucas Antwerpen. Across six months in 2025 we developed an artistic research experiment, sharing our work by sending post packages to each other. Each round a reaction to the previously received package, based on six themes which run through our six individual practices.\
\
In the fall we will come together for a four day residency to create a printed publication around these ever evolving processes, our inability to systematically choose between priority stamps or tracking, and the tangible outcomes. 

On Monday the 20th of October we have organised a moment to share the finished publication, all artistic work that was made and our experiences and methodologies from our first collective project.\
\
‘A Care-full Debriefing’ is named after our shared interest in ethics of care, which we understand as valuing relations over results and not taking *care* for granted.\
\
We are inviting collectives and individuals interested in care-full collaborative art practices and self-organised publication making. All are welcome to join this conversation, to learn how our and other collectives work, our shared and individual experiences and the highlights and struggles throughout a process of collective making.\
\
Copies of the printed publication will be available to exchange with other publications.
