On Friday 23 January, SLARG welcomes George Tebogo Mahashe for a guest lecture in the AdMa room (K.03.09).

Mahashe is an associate professor at the Michaelis School of Fine Art (University of Cape Town). His work moves across photography, museums, archives, and the afterlives of anthropology, operating at the intersection of artistic research and practice. Drawing on khelovedu as a conceptual framework, his practice challenges dominant epistemologies and opens transdisciplinary modes of thinking.

His ongoing research platform *—defunct context* explores collaborations between art, science, technology, and Indigenous Knowledge Systems. This inquiry culminated in the artist book *—defunct context: Ambivalence to important work* (2023), a layered “dreamscape” assembling 15 years of practice through photography, camera obscura, museum refiguration, and collaborative exchange.

Through exhibition projects such as *Pavilion Prototype II: U406*, Mahashe expands photography beyond representation, using installation as a site for participation and collective practice.

A long-standing interlocutor of the Advanced Master, Mahashe also joins SLARG this week as jury member for Bianca Baldi’s public defense.
