In conjunction with the exhibition *Sea Through Skin*, artist Bianca Baldi is in conversation with Miranda Lowe, Principal Curator of Crustacea at the Natural History Museum, London.

The discussion focuses on Baldi’s engagement with the 19th-century glass models of marine invertebrates created by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka, exquisite objects that hover between specimen and sculpture. Through these fragile forms, Baldi and Lowe explore themes central to *Sea Through Skin*: the porous boundaries between art and science, the politics of observation, and how materials – glass, skin, pigment – can hold memory, history, and transformation.

The talk is held in English and is free to attend, though a valid ticket to Extra City is required. Visitors are welcome to view Bianca Baldi's exhibition beforehand.
