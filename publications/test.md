  If we ever believed that colonial violence ended upon entering the educational
  system, we were mistaken. The roots of colonial hegemony, patriarchy, and
  capitalism underlie the very framework of the fashion education system,
  enticing numerous young students each year with aspirations and desires. It
  creates hierarchies, classifications, and othering. The Yarn offers a
  compilation of writings from individuals with an experience of the system as
  students, teachers, or models within the fashion school, and those who
  perceive and question these institutions as places where colonial violence
  persists. It provides a platform for individuals who have encountered or
  witnessed violence related to race, class, and the environment and who desire
  to share their experiences through their written works.\

  This anthology of texts forms part of a wider research endeavour focused on exploring the intersections between colonial hegemonies and the Western fashion system and redefine fashion in the present context. The study involves an examination of the modes of canonization of designers, places and hierarchies within the Western fashion environment. The research delves into the dynamics of colonisation and their impact on the fashion industry between the Global North and South. It also considers how these dynamics are established, propagated, and the ideologies they disseminate.
