description: >-
  Rooted in the apartheid era, the racist term “play-white” connotes a black or
  mixed-race person who lived as a white person. South African artist Bianca
  Baldi draws from research on biomimicry – for instance, the use of rapid
  adaptive camouflage by cephalopods – and her own family history to reflect on
  racial passing and the instability of racial identities. She also looks to
  literary precedents, such as Nella Larsen’s novel ‘Passing’ (1929). In this
  way, her video installation ‘Play-White’ alternates between layers of
  visualisation and moments of discretion in order to explore questions of
  presence and evasion, beyond their broadly accepted representation in black
  and white.




  With contributions by Bianca Baldi, Mika Conradie, Shoniqua Roach, Amy Watson, and others; design by Katharina Tauer & Wolfgang Hückel in collaboration with K. Verlag.
