  This second issue of The Yarn explores colonial violence in fashion museums,
  museums often acting as “hygienist” entities—fixated on “cleansing and
  disinfecting their contaminated past” (Deliss, 2022). At stake here is the
  intersection of two frameworks invented in colonial contexts, fashion and
  museums, and how their entanglement involves specific negotiations. Fashion’s
  sympathy capital has driven many Western museums to curate exhibitions that
  foreground national historiographies through designers’ stories, social
  movements, and selected notable figures. What role, then, does the fashion
  museum play in upholding colonialism and imperialism? This bilingual anthology
  provides a platform for reflecting on the role of fashion museums in the
  decolonial discourse and exploring ways to challenge their foundations. It
  welcomes texts by Alison Moloney, Angela Jansen and Karolien de Clippel,
  Françoise Vergès, Audrey Bartis, Pallavi Chamarty, Morolake Dairo, Sharifa
  Jamaldin, Marius Janusauskas, and Pierre-Antoine Vettorello. It also features
  in dialogues, Kaat Debo, Janice Deul, Gangadhar gaaru, Nashilongweshipwe
  Mushaandja, Nyanchama Okemwa, and Michaëlle Sergile.
