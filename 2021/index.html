        <p><strong># </strong><strong>Generative Design &amp; Machine Learning. One Week Workshop </strong>by Frederik
            De Bleser and Lieven Menschaert. A collective experiment in image-to-image translation, a fascinating
            process of machine learning. We will kick off with an introduction and then narrow it down
            to&nbsp;<em>pix2pix</em>, the formal procedure that we will take as our lead. Get an intro into the
            vocabulary of machine learning and find out what a tensor is, what it means&nbsp;<em>to be given to the
                discriminator&nbsp;</em>and why we should be perhaps a bit more careful with our data. The workshop is
            also a gentle introduction to Figment, inhouse software that serves as an intermediate between the user and
            the rather complex procedures.</p>

        <p><strong># Hate Memes and Countermemes. Lecture </strong>by Tom De Smedt on the European DeTACT Research
            Project<strong>. </strong>In the period from February 2020 to July 2021 we tracked over 15 million toxic
            messages on social media. More than 1,000 trained volunteers responded to (some of) these with a combination
            of countermemes designed by art students, text, and text generated by an AI. This has led to unique insights
            into the “language of hate” and what strategies can work or won’t work when responding to haters on social
            media.</p>

            educational experiences in domestic environments. For a year and a half, we have largely retreated into our
            homes, where we were protected against the&nbsp;coronavirus. During that time, this space, which symbolizes
            safety and security like no other, has changed&nbsp;around us, with kitchens serving as classrooms during
            the day, living rooms alternating between studio, home&nbsp;cinema, and gym, and bedrooms transforming into
            workspaces.&nbsp;The idea of the workshop would be to share about our individual experiences of educational
            systems brought&nbsp;in our personal environments. We will do that through an exercise of sharing and
            listening, describing these&nbsp;places, sharing stories while drawing them in small groups, reflecting on
            what effects did that have on our&nbsp;relation to these spaces.</p>

            models and operates at the intersection of design, open-source, and politics. It&nbsp;performs in a
            cross-sectional educational context and is initiated by Disarming Design from Palestine, in connection to
            the PhD research of Annelys de Vet on alternative design pedagogies, and shaped by PING<em>.</em>PING is a

            telling stories about the other but that also transform the viewer into a political subject. How to make a
            film that does not only confer knowledge about the world, but that also generates self-knowledge and reveals
            one’s own position in relation to the existing power relations. How to speak and imagine from a subaltern
            position and which tools to break the dominant images and narratives?<span

            violence in the context of migration border control in Belgium. By enabling and capturing the collective's
            public forensic investigation into the wider field of causes, this film project leads us to an imagining of
            a thick or wild justice. At the same time, it attempts to construct a ‘holding environment’ in which a
            different way of hearing justice can take place by playing on the senses. <br><b></b></p>

            what would follow: “I don’t have the luxury to be naive.” Out of friction encountered regarding the themes
            of this exhibition arose <i>OK</i>, the first work co-signed by the artists. Central in this piece are text,

            studios in contemporary Balochistan (Pakistan), the project enters the terrain of the vanishing. With the

            backdrops, props, costumes and cameras, the long sessions, the chatting and the manuality that make up the

            means of photographs where individuals are allowed to enter a fantasy world. Focusing on photo studios and

            research at Sint Lucas Antwerpen. Her supervisor Petra Van Brabandt will talk with her about her research
            project <i>Play-White: Racial Passing and Embodied Images</i>. This research introduces a critical approach
            to ‘racial passing’ and its complicity with image production. Someone who can pass for white is socially
            designated as one racial construct but performatively plays out whiteness. Passing complicates our current
            understanding of visual production and categories of identity. Through her image-making practice, Bianca
            Baldi will reflect upon a visual history of racial passing in the South African context. Her research
            functions as a meditation on passing, embodiment, self-presentation, and the aesthetic thresholds of
            identity. <br><b></b></p>

        <p>In his lecture ‘On the Cosmic Caravan, Verticality, and other Human Pursuits’, Vlad Ionescu shares a reading
            of the research and work of Wesley Meuris. How do high-technological tools of observation change our gaze
            towards earth? How to coop with the effects of machine data? <span>How can research and its collection of
                thoughts, sources and objects been transmitted into a (visual) image? The lecture addresses the impact
                of data-collection on two fundamental aspects of visual arts: narrativity and a sense of
                place.&nbsp;</span>Following the lecture, Vlad and Wesley will start a conversation on how the process
            of research finds possible outcomes in an image, a visual language, a communicating setting. During this
            conversation, the participants are also welcomed to intervene and debate on the presented topics. After this
            introduction there will be time and space to discuss work methods of participants. Participants are being
            inquired to bring some material in relating to their research. Through a sharing of source material:
            documents, arguments, drafts and texts, a group discussion intent to articulate some suitable methods to

                    Start</span></b><span lang="EN-US">. </span><span lang="EN-US">To put "the cat on the table" is a
                Finnish expression that means broaching a somewhat difficult or awkward topic, something that might make
                one feel vulnerable or even excited (such as telling someone you are in love with them). That’s what an
                artist’s table often looks like, a place of half-formed but thrilling ideas, of odds and ends, and
                mistakes that perhaps lead to new possibilities. The Advanced Master 2020-21 participants will literally
                put artifacts related to their artistic research on the table (along with assorted snacks and maybe a
                bouquet of flowers) as an invitation to guests and participants to engage in a lively and frank
                discussion on among other things the various “cats" that are at the heart of our practices. The
                collective presentation will also include individual works, as well as a collaborative film made during
                the residency week. </span></p>

                their own keywords to subsequently dissect them based on their own activist experiences and convictions.

        <p><strong># On Sculpture. Sammy Baloji Invites Mo Laudi @ De Singel&nbsp;</strong>This season, two sculptures
            by<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Sammy Baloji</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>will be on display on the stage in the
            Blue Hall of De Singel.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Johari - Brass Band</em></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is
            a pair of works in the form of an enlarged French horn and sousaphone,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>two
                instruments<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>that were left behind in New Orleans by the French army and later
            recuperated by ex-slaves to start up a new musical movement which culminated in brass bands, and which also
            had a strong influence on jazz music. Displayed in black, crystalline structures - an allusion to mineral
            extraction - on stage they become silent witnesses to the uncredited African contributions to musical
            history and to the world.<span>&nbsp;</span><br><br>On Friday 8 October, Sammy Baloji invites the famous
            South African Afro-electro<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>DJ Mo Laudi</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(also a curator
            and researcher at Stellenbosch University) to engage in dialogue with the artwork via music. Just as with
            Sammy Baloji, Mo Laudi's practice is based on<span>&nbsp;</span>research into colonial dynamics in history,
            albeit in music rather than visual art. In<span>&nbsp;</span>a compelling musical
            discourse,<span>&nbsp;</span>Mo Laudi takes the audience on this exciting journey to Congo and South Africa
            via New Orleans and France by means of musical numbers. The evening culminates in a DJ set by Mo Laudi in
            the performers’ bar.<br><br>Mo Laudi composed the sound artwork<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Congo Square in D
                Sharp Minor<span>&nbsp;</span></em>for<span><em>&nbsp;</em></span><em>Johari - Brass Band</em>. Listen

            practices cinema as a form of gathering and communal assembly which entails collective knowledge-production,

            practice while taking its cue from the poem ‘Recreation’ by Audre Lorde. In her poem, Lorde explores a
            double binding of interrelating activities - ‘it is easier to work / after our bodies / meet’ - that led to
            what she claimed was ‘recreation’, with its connotations of play, reciprocity, care, repetition, and

                            Workshop</span></i></b><i><span lang="EN-US">.&nbsp;</span></i><span lang="EN-US">The field
                    of intimacy coordination is growing in both pornography and mainstream commercial film and series,
                    specifically where intimate or sexual scenes are concerned. An Intimacy Coordinator will typically
                    approach their role twofold: 1) They act as a third party to the director/ production company’s
                    demands to ensure the active consent and safety of the physical and mental well-being of actors. 2)
                    They help coordinate the intimate scenes in collaboration with the actors and other production team
                    members, ideally adding specialization and expertise. This work is at a nexus of forming intimacy
                    portrayal, the development of&nbsp;ethical&nbsp;production, and the language surrounding them. As a
                    new role, it raises awareness of the narrative potential intimate acts&nbsp;can have and the
                    negotiation involved in their production.&nbsp;This workshop looks at the parameters of
                    role-playing, acting and authenticity in intimate acts, whether for film, tv, or porn. This workshop
                    would ask us to place ourselves in the role of generators of intimate language rather than
                    observers.&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">It is hosted by Helen Dowling and facilitated
