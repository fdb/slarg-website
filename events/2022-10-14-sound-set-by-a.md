A listening session about deep time and stone temporality, listening positionality, solidified queerness transforming on broken earth, stone butches, pillow rocks and rocky transitions, inhuman geography and racialized geology, animate inanimacy, colliding tectonic plates, crumbling plateaus and non-extractivist frequencies of relationality. 

With thoughts and uttered voices by Kathryn Yusoff, Sara Ahmed, N.K. Jemisin, Dylan Robinson, Audre Lorde, Trinh T. Minh Ha, Mel Y. Chen, Nona Inescu, Sara Maitland, Tracy September, Sally Schonfeldt, Izidora l LETHE, Lava from La Graciosa, Slate Stones from Safiental, et al.
