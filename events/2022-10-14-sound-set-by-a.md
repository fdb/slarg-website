Aio Frei is a non-binary sound artist, relational listener, sonic community organizer, collaborator, sonic researcher, record store co-operator, graphic designer, experimental DJ and fungi enthusiast based in Zürich, Switzerland. They organize concerts, experimental audio formats and collaborate on listening performances and collective listening settings. 

Aio’s practice consist of listening workshops, research-based listening performances, essayistic DJing, semi-modular synthesis, various forms of microphony and free electroacoustic improvisation. They are deeply interested in questions concerning the ‘ethics of listening’ – in socio-political, environmental, embodied and queer practices within situated contexts – emancipatory possibilities within the sonic realm, and forms of non-verbal communication/improvisation. 

Aio works as a freelance graphic designer focusing on sound-related projects, small editions and art books and gives weekly risograph workshops. They are the co-founder of OOR Records/OOR Saloon (one’s own room) in Zürich.
