Through voices from practice we explore experiences in the field of design, politics and pedagogy. How are we preparing designers for a world that is in constant transition? How do we develop critical pedagogies that can be adaptive to unexpected situations, to new questions being posed? How can the design curriculum be a space for commoning? What is the place of design in the wider society, and how can designers respond to urgent matters? How to think about design as a an emancipatory politics, and as a practice of hope?
