**Through voices from practice, we explore experiences in the field of design, politics and pedagogy. How are we preparing designers for a world that is in constant transition? How do we develop critical pedagogies that can be adaptive to unexpected situations, and to new questions being posed? What is the place of design in the wider society, and how can design respond to urgent matters? How can the design curriculum be a space for commoning? How to think about design as emancipatory politics, and as a practice of hope?**

“Design pedagogy as an emancipatory practice” is a one-day-long symposium and workshop around critical pedagogy and design education. A day mostly for peers, with combined presentations and discussions (in the morning), a collective lunch and work sessions (in the afternoon). The contributions will be practice-based rather than rooting in theory, in which we talk from our own examples that touch upon conflict, disruption, flexibility, adaptivity to situations (core perspective) and how each of us secures a healthy creative and adaptive learning environment.

* **Annelys de Vet** (1974, NL) is a Belgium based designer, researcher and educator. Her practice focuses on long-term participatory design projects that engage in social and political struggles. At the Sandberg Instituut Amsterdam, she founded the temporary master's programme 'Disarming Design' (2019-2022), focused on design practices in situations of oppression. From 2009 to 2019, she was the progamme director of the MA in Design at the same academy, the department where she obtained her Masters in 1999. In 2012, she co-initiated the thought provoking design platform 'Disarming Design from Palestine', which brings alternative stories about Palestine and reflects on the function of creative practices in situations of conflict. Another long-term project is the Subjective Editions, a publishing platform that maps areas from the inside out, from a human perspective; publications include Subjective Atlas of Palestine (2007), Subjective Atlas of Brussels (2018), Subjective Atlas of Pakistan (2018) and the Subjective atlas of Amsterdam is expected in early 2023. De Vet is currently a lecturer and PhD researcher at Sint Lucas Antwerp (ARIA), where she researches how design methodologies can contribute to political struggle and emancipation. Her practice based research focuses on how design can act as a catalyst in activating and imagining locally embedded knowledge and experiences, with a special focus on artistic collaborations within the Palestinian context. She will defend her PhD in 2023. [www.disarmingdesign.com](http://www.disarmingdesign.com/)\
