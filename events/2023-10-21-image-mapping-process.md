The talk builds upon my artistic research connected to photo studios in Balochistan, Pakistan. Photographic aesthetics are key terrain around which local communities gather and bring individual fantasies in touch with a sense of belonging to the local community.  Photographs coming out of these studios are not mere representations but are tools for performing life, for becoming. The talk focuses on the reflections interlinked to my artistic practice where I deal with questions related to addressing images wearing different hats such as of a researcher, photographer, filmmaker, collector and an observer with a point of view of a local but displaced (and not local anymore). I will share my image mapping process while navigating semiotics and phenomenology within artistic practices but specific to a place where individuals are allowed to enter a fanasy world, transforming life by means of photographs.
