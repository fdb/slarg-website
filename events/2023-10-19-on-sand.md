Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles, after water it is also the most utilized natural resource on earth. It is present in every structure, road, window, and screen we use daily. As abundant as it seems, it is predicted to become scarce due to overconsumption by industrial use.

'Sandscapes' presents a case study on sand, its finitude and preciousness through four perspectives.

This collaborative artistic research is a result of 'an invitation to think with us’ - from Irma and Saskia to Virág and Eline - to test their research method around the central question: How would you translate finitude through your practice?

Their fieldwork spans across contexts of an archeological site, a construction project, hardware stores and a gem laboratory, looking at ways of connecting specific locations, theory readings, material samples and experiments. The presentation shares physical outcomes of the four participants, curated over scale, referring to the gradualness between a piece of land and a grain of sand.

**This installation can be visited between 11:00-16:00 from Thursday to Saturday.**
