\-﻿---------------------------

**Listen**…to the subject of listening

**Listen**…to the subject who is at the center of listening, who is subject *to* listening

**Listen**…to different things or to same things differently 

**Listen** to this score differently; don’t listen up, listen across the linear time: open up the past to the future every time you listen to the rhythm of the vowels and the consonants

**Listen** with your whole body and let the distortions sink in and rewind 

Can you sense the circuits and nerves intersect?
