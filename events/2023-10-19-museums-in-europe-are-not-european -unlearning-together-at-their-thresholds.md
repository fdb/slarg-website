In this lecture, Professor Azoulay addresses the impossibility of decolonising colonial museums, such as the Belgian Royal Museum for Central Africa, without decolonising the world. Addressing how stolen art, regime of documents and contemporary refugeeism are historically connected, she provides a transnational perspective on decolonisation.

Following the lecture, the student platform wedecolonizevub will moderate a panel discussion with Ariella Aïsha Azoulay, Katarzyna Ruchel-Stockmans (VUB) and a Q&A with the audience.
