In this lecture, Professor Azoulay addresses the impossibility of decolonising colonial museums, such as the Belgian Royal Museum for Central Africa, without decolonising the world. Addressing how stolen art, regime of documents and contemporary refugeeism are historically connected, she provides a transnational perspective on decolonisation.

Following the lecture, the student platform wedecolonizevub will moderate a panel discussion with Ariella Aïsha Azoulay, Katarzyna Ruchel-Stockmans (VUB) and a Q&A with the audience.

### Travelling sources[](https://www.vub.be/en/event/lecture-ariella-aisha-azoulay)

This evening is part of '**Traveling Sources**' - a three-day art & reflec/on program on communi/es traveling imperial borders carrying endangered sources of storytelling. An established academic accompanies the audience in reconciling with the tales and voices of worlds silenced by imperial history. In the 2023 edi/on, we invite Ariella Aïsha Azoulay to guide us on an academic, cinematographic and narra/ve journey on stolen art exhibited in imperial museums. Azoulay invites us to reimagine how displaced communi/es fleeing into Europe are historically connected to the stolen objects exhibited in European colonial museums.
