### Research topics

**Irma** **Foldenyi:**

**Garine Gokceyan:** The project "Exploring Armenian Multiscript Design" investigates the microhistories of Multiscript typography, with a focus on the specificities of diasporic scripts. Taking the Armenian writing system as a laboratory script, I seek to unlearn my westernized design practices and find ways to access written and unwritten archives. The key research questions revolve around the challenges of designing/using contemporary Armenian typefaces and creating discourse around it in the absence of a rulebook, a specific terminology and an understanding of the various perspectives within the diaspora and Հայաստան. 

**Ruth Loos**: In the project "Closer than your jugular vein" (Qur'an 50:16), I explore qualities of the religious book, specifically القرآن الكريم. The search for the multiple identity of this worldly, inter-worldly and other-worldly book proceeds through questions such as: Where/how/when does The Book unfold? I explore 'bookness' through the creation of two communicating works: a sacred text-based, conceptual collection ملامسة الحروف and an artistic-visual collection حديقة قرآنية En route, there is space for experiential and sensory book/faith practice.

**Saskia Van der Gucht:**

**Joud** **Toamah:** "Courtyard of Memory" is a research that centers the practice of طاسة الرعبة or fear soothing bowls, both as a ritualistic practice related to time-space, water and inter-generational relations, and an object with craft knowledges, engraved prayers and traced motifs. How to remember the practice of طاسة الرعبة? How can generational practices of personal and communal protection and medicine be remembered and reactivated in situations of state-violence, erasure, exile and diaspora? I explore these questions through special installations and experimentations with gathering formats based on Courtyard and Barzakh philosophies, poetic imaginaries and critical fabulations.
