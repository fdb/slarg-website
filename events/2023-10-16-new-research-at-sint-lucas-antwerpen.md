### Introduction

Researchers of SLARG who set up a new research project or start up their PhD's will share their research with peers and a wider public. 

Six researchers are presenting and introducing their research question and the methods that will be used to tackle that question. 

* Four new research projects: Tunde Adefioye & Imane Benyecif Khoutoul, Ruth Loos, Joud Toamah and Saskia Van der Gucht. 
* Two new PhD projects: Irma Foldenyi, Garine Gokceyan. 

Each presentation lasts 30 min, Q&A included. 

**Ruth Loos**: In the project "Closer than your jugular vein" (Qur'an 50:16), I explore qualities of the religious book, specifically القرآن الكريم. The search for the multiple identity of this worldly, inter-worldly and other-worldly book proceeds through questions such as: Where/how/when does The Book unfold? I explore 'bookness' through the creation of two communicating works: a sacred text-based, conceptual collection ملامسة الحروف and an artistic-visual collection حديقة قرآنية En route, there is space for experiential and sensory book/faith practice.
