Curious about the new SLARG research projects? Come to our sharing session afternoon! 



**Irma Földényi:** 

**Garine Gokceyan:** The project **Exploring Armenian Multiscript Design** investigates the microhistories of Multiscript typography, with a focus on the specificities of diasporic scripts. Taking the Armenian writing system as a laboratory script, I seek to unlearn my westernized design practices and find ways to access written and unwritten archives. The key research questions revolve around the challenges of designing/using contemporary Armenian typefaces and creating discourse around it in the absence of a rulebook, a specific terminology and an understanding of the various perspectives within the diaspora and Հայաստան. 

**Ruth Loos**: In the project "Closer than your jugular vein" (Qur'an 50:16), I explore qualities of the religious book, specifically القرآن الكريم. The search for the multiple identity of this worldly, inter-worldly and other-worldly book proceeds through questions such as: Where/how/when does The Book unfold? I explore 'bookness' through the creation of two communicating works: a sacred text-based, conceptual collection ملامسة الحروف and an artistic-visual collection حديقة قرآنية En route, there is space for experiential and sensory book/faith practice.

**Saskia Van der Gucht:**

**Joud** **Toamah:** "Courtyard of Memory" is a research that centers the practice of طاسة الرعبة or fear soothing bowls, both as a ritualistic practice related to time-space, water and inter-generational relations, and an object with craft knowledges, engraved prayers and traced motifs. How to remember the practice of طاسة الرعبة? How can generational practices of personal and communal protection and medicine be remembered and reactivated in situations of state-violence, erasure, exile and diaspora? I explore these questions through special installations and experimentations with gathering formats based on Courtyard and Barzakh philosophies, poetic imaginaries and critical fabulations.

**Imane Benyecif & Tundé Adefioye** In the last few years, the idea of safe and safer spaces have become part of what many of us try and create in and out of institutions. But what are Braver Spaces, what are the best ways to aspire towards them and eventually create them?  Since the beginning of 2021 a small initiative started by some young people and two lecturers, has aspired to answer this question. This has been done through weekly meetings, healing spaces, Supper Clubs and a Summer School. This year, we want to slow down in order to reflect on what we have done and where we want to go, if. Through discussions and reflections, we hope to gain more clarity about the work we are trying to do.
