 habit(u)s 

a search for old, new, present, past, future, 

the things that stay with the things that leave

(un)commoning our stories 

a heritage shared (without exposure)  

\*\*

Following the ending of their Advanced Master of Research year at Sint Lucas, seven participans have banded together and taken on a residency at Frans Masereel Centrum. With a variety of expertise and an eagerness to reconnect, we embraced the residency as an opportunity for play, exploration and learning from/with each other. Over the course of ten days, we have lived communally: cooking, breathing, stretching, and working in a myriad of printing techniques. We are happy to be presenting the residency’s outcomes as part of SLARG Research week. Our work  will be on display in the Morpho Refectoire over the course of the weekend, 14th-16th,  opening hours: Saturday: 11:00-17:00
