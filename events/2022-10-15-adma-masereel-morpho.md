 habit(u)s 

a search for old, new, present, past, future, 

the things that stay with the things that leave

(un)commoning our stories 

a heritage shared (without exposure)

Following the ending of their Advanced Master of Research year at Sint Lucas Antwerp, seven participans have banded together and taken on a residency at Frans Masereel Centrum. With a variety of expertise and an eagerness to reconnect, we embraced the residency as an opportunity for play, exploration and learning from/with each other. Over the course of ten days, we have lived communally: cooking, breathing, stretching, and working in a myriad of printing techniques. We are happy to be presenting the residency’s outcomes as part of SLARG Research week. Our work will be on display in the Morpho Refectory

Participants: Yingda Dong - Christine Ivanov - Dages Juvelier Keates - Amit Leblang - Anat Martkovich - Tijana Petrovi - Vasiliki Stasinaki.
