### Introduction

*Artistic research:* 

TYPP is the journal for artistic research of Sint Lucas School of Arts in Antwerp. It brings together artistic research practices, without any hierarchy or a predefined format. It seeks to offer a forum for the field of artistic research, which is averse to categories and continuously reinvents and reorients itself. The editorial board is responsible for the composition of each periodical.

In the newest version of TYPP their are sparkling contributions by researchers Marnie Slater, Frederik De Bleser, Helen Dowling, Ine Vanoeveren, Annelys de Vet, Lieven Menschaert, Danial Shah and Paul Hendrikse. 

This is all brought together by the graphic designer Ward Heirwegh, who produces each time another 'unique' design for TYPP. 

*Adma's TYPP:*

From within the Advanced Master Share Research module, each year a new group of students produce their own version of TYPP to open up conversation as a mode of research and practice. 

Its coordinator, Marnie Slater, previously stated this, to clarify its editorial modus: 

'It will focus on conversation as a form of exchange, as a relational mode of research, as a collective possibility of knowledge-making, of learning, and of thinking processes made public. We will approach conversation as an expanded field of possibilities that includes interviews, more informal or unstructured exchanges in voice, image or text, intimate moments of connection, and acts of appropriation, mimicry, time travel and translation.'
