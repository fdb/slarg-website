  *They can’t say anything* 

  *And they don’t*

  *We can say anything*

  *But we won’t* 

  Instead of saying, she looked at me with caring determination

  She licked her thumb and pressed it on my cheek wiping the stain I didn’t even notice was there

  I thought it was icky, but felt like home

### More on TYPP

TYPP is the journal for artistic research of Sint Lucas School of Arts in Antwerp. It brings together artistic research practices, without any hierarchy or a predefined format. It seeks to offer a forum for the field of artistic research, which is averse to categories and continuously reinvents and reorients itself. The editorial board is responsible for the composition of each periodical.

TYPP #9 harbours contributions by researchers Marnie Slater, Frederik De Bleser, Helen Dowling, Ine Vanoeveren, Annelys de Vet, Lieven Menschaert, Danial Shah and Paul Hendrikse. 

This is all brought together again by graphic designer Ward Heirwegh, who produces each time another 'unique' design for TYPP.

From within the Advanced Master Share Research module, each year a new group of students produce their own version of TYPP, *ADMA TYPP*, to open up conversation as a mode of research and practice. Tonight *ADMA TYPP #3 ...* 

Its coordinator, Marnie Slater, clarifies its editorial approach: 

'It will focus on conversation as a form of exchange, as a relational mode of research, as a collective possibility of knowledge-making, of learning, and of thinking processes made public. We will approach conversation as an expanded field of possibilities that includes interviews, more informal or unstructured exchanges in voice, image or text, intimate moments of connection, and acts of appropriation, mimicry, time travel and translation.'
