These fragmented media are firstly extracts from Việt Vũ's own "memory work" on how he grew up as a queer person in Vietnam and became a self-taught filmmaker in such a socio-political context that exist lots of push-and-pull and repressing factors. More than that, they included textual (and visual) data from more than 20 interviews that Việt Vũ have made with his fellow filmmakers, especially independent ones, about the contemporary film making scene in Vietnam since early 2000s. Narrating from a first-person point of view, the filmmaker/researcher is trying to paint a collective portrait of a new and bold generation of filmmakers in a peculiar social environment.
