We present a dialogue between two realms of sensory exploration: one centered around tactile engagement, the other steeped in auditory experience. Both challenge the audience to delve into embodied perception. This poses compelling questions: How is our understanding of sensory perception and embodiment evolving in an era suffused with artificial intelligence? And is it possible that AI, rather than distancing us from our own sensory experiences, could deepen our connection to them?

## BREATHLESS

*Performance by Mona Hedayati*

Breathless is a sound performance developed using machine learning for sound generation based on frequent somatic marker data (biosensing and audio recording libraries) collected from the artist's body during watching videos of the latest widespread protests in Iran. These libraries were then used as the basis for a sound design that is modulated using live sensor data towards a performance that aims to showcase the affective frequencies of the artist during this episode.

## CARESS — Care and Touch in the Age of AI

*An interactive AI exhibit initiated by Frederik De Bleser and Lieven Menschaert. Performances by Alexandra Fraser, Nika Dela Loncha and Madina Mahomedova.*

Our bodies crave to be touched. But how can we caress and love somebody when we can only see them through a screen? For the first time, we provide CARESS — a sensual AI that you can touch and fondle. Reach out and touch a face; feel the warmth of their face in your empty hands. Let us touch you, by touching us.
