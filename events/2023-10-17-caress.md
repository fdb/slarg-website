Our bodies crave to be touched. But how can we caress and love somebody when we can only see them through a screen? For the first time, we provide CARESS — a sensual AI that you can touch and fondle. Reach out and touch a face; feel the warmth of their face in your empty hands. Let us touch you, by touching us.

An interactive AI exhibit that created by recording of artists and performers Alexandra Fraser, Nika Dela Loncha, Madina Mahomedova, initiated by Frederik De Bleser and Lieven Menschaert.

Performance by Mona Hedayati
