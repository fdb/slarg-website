This workshop will introduce participants to the “working bee,” an organizing tool for collective making, and create a participatory moment within the final stage in my current research project. The one-year research project focusses on tools and strategies for queer, feminist and anti-racist collaboration in and beyond the art field. 

During the workshop, I will share my experiences with working bees and then together we will activate this tool to collectively experiment with techniques for binding a zine on tools and strategies for collaboration. While we work together, we will take the time to informally meet each other and exchange our experiences with self-organizing. The zine, called “Tools #0,” will mark the end of my one-year research project and this workshop will serve as a participatory zine launch. Participants are welcome to take a copy of the zine at the end of the workshop.

**The workshop will be held in chosen mixity. This means it is open for anyone (students, staff and public) who identifies as queer and/or feminist. Subscribe: marnie.slater@kdg.be**
