This evening is part of '**Traveling Sources**' - a three-day art & reflec/on program on communi/es traveling imperial borders carrying endangered sources of storytelling. An established academic accompanies the audience in reconciling with the tales and voices of worlds silenced by imperial history. In the 2023 edi/on, we invite Ariella Aïsha Azoulay to guide us on an academic, cinematographic and narra/ve journey on stolen art exhibited in imperial museums. Azoulay invites us to reimagine how displaced communi/es fleeing into Europe are historically connected to the stolen objects exhibited in European colonial museums.
