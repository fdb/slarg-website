### Introduction

In this workshop, we will explore the art of dyeing natural textiles using Indigo, a plant-based dyeing method celebrated globally for its symbolic and spiritual significance. We are thrilled to have Ghent-based fiber artist and educator, **Lieve Jacob**, as our guide in mastering the techniques of rejuvenating old garments into fresh, vibrant creations.

### What

We kindly request participants to bring a cherished (small) garment, preferably in a light natural fiber, that you wish to transform using this enchanting blue dye. 

Changing the canon and combating the coloniality of Fashion also means collectively practicing ancient techniques. We will re-imagine, re-make and re-indigenise our garments. 

Duration: 3h
