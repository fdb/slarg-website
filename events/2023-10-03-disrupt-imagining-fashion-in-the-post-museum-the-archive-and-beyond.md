In this workshop, we will explore the art of dyeing natural textiles using Indigo, a plant-based dyeing method celebrated globally for its symbolic and spiritual significance. We are thrilled to have Belgian fiber artist and educator, Live Jacob, as our guide in mastering the techniques of rejuvenating old garments into fresh, vibrant creations.

Please note that this workshop has limited available seats, and we kindly request participants to bring a cherished garment, preferably in a light natural fiber, that you wish to transform using this enchanting blue dye. 

Changing the canon and combating colonially of Fashion means also collectively practicing ancient techniques. We will re-imagine, re-make and re-indigenise our garments. 

Duration: 4h
