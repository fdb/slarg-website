The Post Film Collective screens and discusses their film *Rerooting.* 

After the screening their will be an aftertalk with some of its members, Robin Vanbesien and the participants.

One of its members, Elli Vassalou, conveyed this about the film  in a recent interview in March of this year in the film magazine *Fantomas*:

'For the film Rerooting, we went to the Ardennes with the question of how we can reconnect with nature in Belgium since, as migrants, we have lost our homeland. One of us, Sawsan \[Maher], could not be with us because she had to stay at home with her children. The distance we unfortunately experience more often, due to lack of government support for migrant mothers, led us to create cinéletters, a language we can use to be closer to each other and build a safe space together. In Rerooting's cinéletters, two generations of migrants, mothers and daughters, communicate with each other.'

### The Post (Film) Collective

The Post Collective was founded in 2018. It is a collective collaboration between migrant artists and activists from Belgium. The Post Film Collective has existed since 2020 and tries to translate all its experiences into the medium of film. SLARG researcher Robin Vanbesien is involved in this and helps to connect the collective to the local scene(s).
