"With the notion that when you tell a story in assembly there is no owner, as the story creates the assembly, we are trying to find our own ‘story,' which will create its own assembly." The Post Film Collective

The Post Film Collective screens and discusses their film *Rerooting* (2023, 19')*.* 

After the screening their will be an aftertalk with some of its members, Robin Vanbesien and the participants.

In *Rerooting,* a multitude of voices, languages, and translations are spun together like the threads of a spider's web to bridge a space in which the creators are together on an audiovisual journey in which they seek to understand and reinforce each other. The voices wander and echo through the forest, making their way along uninhabited paths. The vast space that belongs to no one, and also to everyone, unfolds as the film also sets out as a work of many authors together. 

One of its members, Elli Vassalou, conveyed this about the film  in a recent interview in March of this year in the film magazine *Fantomas*:

'For the film *Rerooting,* we went to the Ardennes with the question of how we can reconnect with nature in Belgium since, as migrants, we have lost our homeland. One of us, Sawsan \[Maher], could not be with us because she had to stay at home with her children. The distance we unfortunately experience more often, due to lack of government support for migrant mothers, led us to create cinéletters, a language we can use to be closer to each other and build a safe space together. In Rerooting's cinéletters, two generations of migrants, mothers and daughters, communicate with each other.'

### The Post (Film) Collective

THE POST COLLECTIVE is an autonomous platform of co-creation, co-learning and cultural activism created by Mahammed Alimu, Marcus Bergner, Hooman Jalidi, Sawsan Maher, Mirra Markhaeva, and Elli Vassalou, artists with different means and access to artistic production due to their legal status (refugees, asylum seekers, sans-papiers, regular citizens). Generative modes of kinship, solidarity, dialogue and storytelling form the basis of their speculative and experiental approaches to art + design. Since 2020, in collaboration with Robin Vanbesien, THE POST FILM COLLECTIVE elaborates on the work and experiences of The Post Collective in the realm of cinema.
