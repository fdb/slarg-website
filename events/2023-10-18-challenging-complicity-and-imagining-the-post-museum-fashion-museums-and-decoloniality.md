### Introduction

A two hours workshop on zine-making and creative writing - part of the research seminar 'Disrupt! Imagining Fashion in the Post-Museum, the Archive and Beyond', organized by Pierre-Antoine Vettorello (Oct 3-4). 

During this workshop, we will explore the concept of creating a zine that will incorporate elements from our research seminar discussions. Participants will uncover the rationale behind producing this publication, its underlying purpose, and engage in conversations about its format, potential avenues, and opportunities for collaboration.

10:00 - 12:00  ZINE MAKING

* Discussion and info-session on writing and documenting the seminar for a zine publication
