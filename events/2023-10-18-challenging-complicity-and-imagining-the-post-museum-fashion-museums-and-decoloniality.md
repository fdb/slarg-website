2h workshop over zine-making and creative writing, part of the research seminar 'Disrupt! Imagining Fashion in the Post-Museum, the Archive and Beyond' (hyperlink with this pre-event)

During this workshop, we will explore the concept of creating a zine that will incorporate elements from our research seminar discussions. Participants will uncover the rationale behind producing this publication, its underlying purpose, and engage in conversations about its format, potential avenues, and opportunities for collaboration.

Research seminar initiated by Pierre-Antoine Vettorello
