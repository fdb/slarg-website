**This screening is open to all.**

*The (Bureau)creative Age* is a research that finds itself tangled within a corporate, economic and bureaucratic environment and is explored inside an artistic parafiction. The artist plays with an overlap between fact and fiction through the imagination of the *Research Centre on Creative Abilities meandmywork.*

The story in which *meandmywork* is ultimately set up as a fictitious character, over-identifies itself with the bureaucratic and corporate processes experienced in the business field of creativity incorporated. In order to leave the door open for speculation, the research is an artistic act of futuring: a process to think about the future, envision what may happen, and to gain insight into actions to take in the present.

Several different layers were constructed meticulously to work on the truthiness of the story while at the same time adjusting sentences, words, visuals, ways of editing, etc. that hint the fabrication of the whole fiction. Real interviews bring about other reflections and opinions and strengthen the documentary’s credibility.

*Sarah Hendrickx is a visual artist and obtained her PhD in the arts from Sint Lucas Antwerp (ARIA) in March 2022. She teaches Sociology of Creative Industries, is part of the artists' collective Dani O'Dean and continues to develop the visual arts programme at RADAR Mechelen.*
