Six researchers will finalize their research by the end of this year or the beginning of 2024. 

Today they share their findings with peers and a wider public.

Each presentation is 30 min (Q&A included). 

Appointed respondents will set up a first question for the audience. 

The conversation is open to all. 

### **Presentations:**

— The PhD research '**Disarming Design**' by **Annelys de Vet** centres around three self-initiated long-term participative design projects that engage with social and political struggles. They are the bottom-up cartographic publishing platform ’Subjective Editions’, the thought provoking design label ‘Disarming Design from Palestine’ and the temporary masters programme ‘Disarming Design’. With her research De Vet asks fundamental questions about these practices and contextualises the collaborations, aesthetics and methodologies. What is design’s potential to foster collaboration and change? How can design disarm the status quo?

— **Marnie Slater**'s research project '**Sharing Tools and Strategies for Transformative Art Collaboration**' addresses the methodologies used in queer, feminist and anti-racist art collaboration. The research emerged from challenges she identified though her collective practice within the visual arts. Namely, that although there is an increasing interest in collaboration as a transformative practice, artists are under-tooled to work together. During this one-year research project, she asked: How are transformative art collaborations embedding their aims within their collective working methodologies and how can I share these tools and strategies with others?
