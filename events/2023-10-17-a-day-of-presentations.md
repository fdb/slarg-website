Seven researchers will finalize their research by the end of this year or the beginning of 2024. 

Today they share their findings with peers and a wider public their findings.

Each presentation is 30 min (questions included). 

It will be build around three leading questions: 

* What is your research question?
* What did you or will you do to find an answer to that question? 

  + Illustrate this (when possible)?
* What is your answer to your question (final research projects)?
