This film is a sequel to Azoulay’s Un-Documented–Unlearning Imperial Plunder (2019) is about the mass colonial plunder of Africa and how objects are held captive in museums and archives outside of their origin.



If you have more images/stills, we can add too. 

How does this screening relate to the whole program?

You can then hyperlink to the other two events. 

This is a more boring 'general' bio from Azoulay but maybe we can adapt to what she brings to the table during those three days?
