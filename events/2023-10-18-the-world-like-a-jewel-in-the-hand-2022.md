This screening is the first evening of a three-day art and reflection program in Brussels around the work of researcher, writer and curator Ariella Aïsha Azoulay. 

*The world like a jewel in the hand* is the latest film essay by Azoulay. The film engages with stolen art to question the imperial foundations of the world we live in. Narrating the destruction of the Jewish Muslim world in North-Africa through imperial technologies of colonizing, partitioning, mining, stealing, archiving, and exhibiting, Azoulay invites us to reclaim the world of skills, care for the world enshrined in stolen objects, and inhabit ruined worlds we are being told could no longer exist. 

Following the film screening an after talk between Ariella Azoulay and Nadia Fadil will be moderated by Laura Gaelle Ganza. 

The follow-up events with Azoulay are:

19/10: A Lecture by Ariella Aïsha Azoulay, 'Museums in Europe are not European'. For more [here](https://kaaitheater.be/en/agenda/museums-in-europe-are-not-european).

20/10: A Performance 'Travelling Sources, Between Two Cups of Tea', with Ariella Aïsha Azoulay, Juna Suleiman, Hagar Ophir, Navid Fayaz, The Kitchen and Space Fxmme. For more [here](https://kaaitheater.be/en/agenda/travelling-sources-between-two-cups-of-tea).

This screening is part of '**[Travelling Sources](https://kaaitheater.be/en/agenda/travelling-sources)**' - a three-day art & reflection program on communities traveling imperial borders carrying endangered sources of storytelling. An established academic accompanies the audience in reconciling with the tales and voices of worlds silenced by imperial history. In the 2023 edition, we invite Ariella Aïsha Azoulay to guide us on an academic, cinematographic and narrative journey on stolen art exhibited in imperial museums. Azoulay invites us to reimagine how displaced communities fleeing into Europe are historically connected to the stolen objects exhibited in European colonial museums.
