**This workshop is open to Sint Lucas Antwerpen researchers only.**

This workshop is a moment for researchers who work with/in collectives, collaborations and communities to share their methodologies. Specifically, I am interested in opening up a discussion about how those of us engaged in institutionally supported research work with collaborators and communities outside of institutional structures. 

The workshop will focus on sharing the processes and direct experiences of workshop participants, with the hope that those in the workshop can learn from each other.
