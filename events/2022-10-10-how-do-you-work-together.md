*Open to Sint Lucas Antwerpen researchers only*

10-13h, followed by lunch from 13-14h

This workshop is a moment for researchers who work with/in collectives, collaborations and communities to share their methodologies. Specifically, I am interested in opening up a discussion about how those of us engaged in institutionally supported research work with collaborators and communities outside of institutional structures. 

The workshop will focus on sharing the processes and direct experiences of workshop participants, with the hope that those in the workshop can learn from each other.

In preparation for the workshop, I invite you to select one question from the list below that is relevant or challenging for the way you work with others in your research. Please prepare a short presentation in response to this question (10 minutes maximum). Try to be as concrete and precise as possible, by, for example, sharing one real life tool, strategy or experience in detail.

For those who register, I will also send a (short and accessible) text that was inspiring to me in thinking about collaborating as a researcher.

Please select one question:

* As an individually supported researcher who is engaged in collaborative research, what are some of the benefits for you personally? For your collaborations? And are there contradictions?
* Does your research navigate (perhaps personal, intimate) collaborative relationships? Why is this important to your research? What are some of the tensions you experience?
* Do you have a formalized, ethical framework/s for collaborating within your research? What does it do and can you share it with us?
* Do you collaborate with communities that you are also part of? How do you enable your research process, results or resources to feed back into your communities?
* Do you collaborate with people who are not waged for their work, while you are? Do you address this financial imbalance? How?
* Are there institutional hurdles that you have encountered in working with collaborators or on the subject of collaboration? How did you navigate those?
* Are you a researcher who also teaches within an art school context? How does your interest, knowledge and skills in collaboration come into the classroom?
