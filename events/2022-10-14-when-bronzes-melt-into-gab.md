This workshop interrogates the possibility of training monuments to be relational objects and allies for alternative futures. The relationship the present has with monuments will be the starting point. Using online maps and images, we'll work with concepts of monument-hack, monument-specific, and resonance to explore possible performative uses of the monuments proposed by the participants.
