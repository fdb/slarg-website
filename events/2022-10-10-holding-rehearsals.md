In the seminar *Holding Rehearsals* I share the *what*, *why,* and *how* behind the feature film-in-the-making *Holding Mawda.* This seminar is an invitation to explore together the intentions, questions, themes, and methods of the film, which is part of my PhD research Ciné Place-Making.

*Mawda Shawri, a two-year-old girl, was shot and murdered by a police officer during a car chase on the highway E42 in Mons, Belgium, on May 17, 2018. This happened within the framework of the police operation Medusa for migration border control, mandated by the Belgian federal government. Mawda was shot and killed when she was sitting in a van with her fugitive Kurdish Iraqi family. The bullet, apparently aimed at the wheel of the van carrying around thirty fugitive people, was fired through the window and hit her cheek. From the moment of Mawda’s death, a series of painfully dehumanising measures were inflicted on the family even as extraordinary attempts were made to control the official narrative about the chain of events that led to her death – so as to deflect blame from the police operation that preceded it.*

What film can *hold* the capacity and imagination of collective counter-justice that has been built in support of Mawda’s family, operating in the gap that is stretched between, on the one hand, a language of legal procedures whereby police impunity is bound up with the criminalization of “migrants,” and, on the other hand, the scandal of indifference that let this case, like many others, pass? 

Cinema refers to so much more than just a medium, and certainly to so much more than an industry. In the very first place, cinema functions as a holding environment for collective imaginations. The question therefore is how to envisage another scene of representation.

Robin Vanbesien is a visual artist and filmmaker. He is a PhD researcher at Sint Lucas as well as the coordinator of the Master in a Socio-Political Context. His work has been widely presented internationally.
