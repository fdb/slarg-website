In the seminar *Holding Rehearsals* I share the *what*, *why,* and *how* behind the feature film-in-the-making *Holding Mawda.*

*Mawda Shawri, a two-year-old girl, was shot and murdered by a police officer during a car chase on the highway E42 in Mons, Belgium, on May 17, 2018. This happened within the framework of the police operation Medusa for migration border control, mandated by the Belgian federal government. Mawda was shot and killed when she was sitting in a van with her fugitive Kurdish Iraqi family. The bullet, apparently aimed at the wheel of the van carrying around thirty fugitive people, was fired through the window and hit her cheek. From the moment of Mawda’s death, a series of painfully dehumanising measures were inflicted on the family even as extraordinary attempts were made to control the official narrative about the chain of events that led to her death – so as to deflect blame from the police operation that preceded it.*

What film approach can *hold* the capacity and imagination of collective counter-justice that has been built in support of Mawda’s family, operating in the gap that is stretched between, on the one hand, a language of legal procedures whereby police impunity is bound up with the criminalization of “migrants,” and, on the other hand, a scandal about the resulting indifference that lets this case, like many others, pass?

As to what has become known as the case of Mawda, from 2018 to 2021 various citizens in different ways reconstructed the true course of events and organized numerous gatherings and expressions of support with the parents. *Holding Mawda* acknowledges how this citizens’ reconstruction of the public truth has built a collectively lived imagination toward social justice. The film makes a re-enactment of it in collaboration with these citizens, using participatory work methods. The citizens’ reconstruction starts with the acknowledgement that justice cannot be achieved through a language of legal procedures whereby police impunity is bound up with the criminalization of “migrants”. In response, they launch a collective search for social justice that inverts the state-citizen relationship and questions governmental systemic racism and violence. After all, the Mawda case has deep-lying, systemic causes that cannot be adequately grasped or undone by these legal and institutional frameworks because they themselves are ultimately part of the problem. On that account, the citizens constitute a forum or assembly for which justice is grounded as a tangible environment: a social landscape. As the film unfolds, we listen to the various perspectives, analyses, feelings, and experiences of the different voices that inhabit this social landscape in support of Mawda’s family and against police and state violence at large.

Cinema refers to so much more than just a medium, and certainly to so much more than an industry. In the very first place, cinema functions as a holding environment for collective imaginations. This is especially relevant on the matter of living through dominant scenes of representations that obscure the violent processes and oppressive infrastructures that produce group-differentiated vulnerability to premature death. How to envisage another scene of representation? The social landscape of the assembly enables the capacity *to hear something different*, which is foundational to nurturing the ongoing work of civic life.

This seminar is part of the PhD research *Ciné Place-Making*.
