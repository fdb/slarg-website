In a world of climate disaster, climate disputes are more frequent than ever. In this series of short talks we will shed light on the concept of "rights of nature" and "ecological justice".

First, Dorine Van Norren will discuss various indigenous worldviews and philosophies that inspire the concept of the "rights of nature".  Afterwards, Mihnea Tanasescu will unravel the history of concepts "nature" and "rights" and delve deeper into their relationship. Klaas Kuitenbrouwer will explain the new Zoöp model that recently took effect at the New Institute in Rotterdam and is inspired by the "rights of nature" movement. This Zoöp model makes the voices and interests of non-human life part of decision-making processes. Aoife Fleming discusses the practice of "climate litigation" and highlights the currently ongoing campaign to take "climate change" to the International Court of Justice. 

The talks are followed by a Q&A.
