*This event is part of Rights of Nature, a two-day cross-disciplinary program by SLARG, in close collaboration withÂ [Klimaatfestival Antwerpen](https://www.klimaatfestivalantwerpen.be/nl), FOMU, and Kunsthal Extra City. Rights of Nature explores the role of law, philosophy and arts in relation to "rights of nature". It brings together various forms of research and translates this to a wide audience.*
