In her lecture, curator Heidi Ballet talks about how water offers new perspectives in curatorial practice. Water is seen here in the geographical sense, through a renewed focus on oceans as an important territory, and in the ecological sense, by approaching water as matter shared and recycled between humans and the environment, as hydrofeminism states.

*Heidi Ballet is a curator at DE SINGEL in Antwerp. She curated, among others, Beaufort 2021, Beaufort 2018 and LIAF 2017 in Lofoten (Norway).*

*This event is part of Rights of Nature, a two-day cross-disciplinary program by SLARG, in close collaboration withÂ [Klimaatfestival Antwerpen](https://www.klimaatfestivalantwerpen.be/nl), FOMU, Curatorial Studies KASK Gent, and Kunsthal Extra City. Rights of Nature explores the role of law, philosophy and arts in relation to "rights of nature". It brings together various forms of research and translates this to a wide audience.*
