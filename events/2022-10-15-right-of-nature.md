*Silent Echoes* is a video and performance piece developen by Dutch artist [Dorine van Meel](http://dorinevanmeel.com/) in collaboration with sound artist [Sami El-Enany](http://www.el-enany.com/). The project includes poetic and musical contributions by artists, writers, singers [Khairani Barokka](http://www.khairanibarokka.com/), [Jamaica Heolimeleikalani Osorio](https://jamaicaosorio.wordpress.com/), Serie Barford, Ucetōt Lorok and Dorine van Meel. The work is a collaborative effort and develops over time on different platforms, accumulating contributions. 

*Silent Echoes* addresses the climate crisis through these various poetic contributions written by poets, activists and singers who come from different islands across the Pacific Ocean. Each poem or song highlights different ways in which the climate crisis unfolds on these islands through the workings of (neo-)colonialist practices past and present. Whether it is because of the poisoning of the water due to the presence of military remnants from World War II, because of the clearing of the original forests and the planting of endless fields of palm trees for the production of palm oil, because of the suppression of the language and culture of the indigenous population by the colonial settlers or because of the nuclear tests that were carried out on the atolls without any regard of the people living there. As much as these poems and songs mourn the loss of life – in all its different forms, they also speak of resistance, endurance and cohabitation, and offer a hopeful view for our world in the face of a dark present and an uncertain future. 

The images that accompany the many voices show computer generated islands in which digital waves turn into digital grains of desert sand, presenting the viewer with a dystopian vision, in which an unfolding ecological catastrophe is implied. Images of industrial tools and corporate objects appear in distorted shapes, as silent echoes of a past, in which the course of history has not been reversed.

Silent Echoes has received financial support from the Mondriaan Fonds.

Biographies

Dorine van Meel (1984) is a Dutch artist whose practice takes the form of video installations, performances, discursive projects and long-term collaborations. In her video work, digitally produced images are combined with composed soundtracks and texts read by the artist as well as other female narrators. Van Meel’s solo work has been shown at the 10th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art (Berlin), the South London Gallery (London), W139 (Amsterdam), Transmediale (Berlin), Nottingham Contemporary (Nottingham), KW Institute for Contemporary Art (Berlin). 

Sami El-Enany is a British Egyptian artist who works with sound, often negotiating the fringes of modern classical, electronica and field recording. His practice ranges widely from composition and sound design for screen, radio art, game design and record production. Recent works include Deadly Structures – a sound-only first-person exploration videogame produced by the ICA and the BBC, the film score for Walking With Shadows -the first LGBTQ+ Nollywood feature film ever made, and his debut album Opix, released on the London based Faith and Industry record label. 

Khairani Barokka is a Minang-Javanese writer and artist from Jakarta, based in London, whose work centres disability justice as anticolonial praxis. She often focuses on ableist racism and patriarchy as affective flows in contemporary colonial violences, including in the fine art world and archives. Okka is the new incoming Editor of Modern Poetry in Translation, and previously worked at University of the Arts London. She holds a PhD by Practice in Visual Cultures from Goldsmiths. 

Jamaica Heolimeleikalani Osorio is a Kanaka Maoli wahine artist / activist / scholar / storyteller born and raised in Pālolo Valley to parents Jonathan and Mary Osorio. Jamaica earned her PhD in English (Hawaiian literature) in 2018 from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Currently, Jamaica is an Assistant Professor of Indigenous and Native Hawaiian Politics at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Jamaica is a three-time national poetry champion, poetry mentor and a published author. In 2020 her poetry and activism were the subject of an award-winning film, This is the Way we Rise which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2021. 

Serie (Cherie) Barford was born in Aotearoa New Zealand and lives in West Auckland. Her collections of poetry include Plea to the Spanish Lady (1985), Glass Canisters (1989), Tapa Talk (2007), Sleeping with Stones (2021), and the poetry and prose collection Entangled Islands (2015). She is of Samoan and European descent, and her work explores hybrid identities, seeking meaning in “the space between,” as she has described it: “the betweenness, not empty space, not space that separates but space that relates, that holds separate entities and things together in the Unity-that-is-All, the space that is context, giving meaning to things.” 

Ucetōt Lorok is a singer from the Marshall Islands.



*This event is part of Rights of Nature, a two-day cross-disciplinary program by SLARG, in close collaboration with [Klimaatfestival Antwerpen](https://www.klimaatfestivalantwerpen.be/nl), FOMU, and Kunsthal Extra City. Rights of Nature explores the role of law, philosophy and arts in relation to "rights of nature". It brings together various forms of research and translates this to a wide audience.*
