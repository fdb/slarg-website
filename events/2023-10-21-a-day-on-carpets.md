Hussein Shikha will talk about the design choices he made for the carpet piece he will be showing at Extra City. Why are certain elements combined? What do the drawing refer to? Apart from the themes and techniques involved, he will give an insight into the conflicts and challenges he experiences in the making process.

CARPETLAND. Critical tapestries @ Kunsthal Extra City

27.10.2023 – 03.03.2024

Curated by Joachim Naudts

Tapestries have been one of the most prestigious art forms throughout centuries. After a first brief revival in the seventies, not accidentally during second-wave feminism, this labour intensive form of textile art is again at the forefront of contemporary artistic practices. The tongue in cheek titled exhibition Carpetland is putting a focus on a multitude of contemporary positions.
