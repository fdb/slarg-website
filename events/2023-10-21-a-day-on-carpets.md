CARPETLAND. Critical tapestries @ Kunsthal Extra City

27.10.2023 â€“ 03.03.2024

Curated by Joachim Naudts

Tapestries have been one of the most prestigious art forms throughout centuries. After a first brief revival in the seventies, not accidentally during second-wave feminism, this labour intensive form of textile art is again at the forefront of contemporary artistic practices. The tongue in cheek titled exhibition Carpetland is putting a focus on a multitude of contemporary positions.

Artists: Igshaan Adams, Saiqa Ejaz,  Khalil Rabah, Golnesa Rezaneshad, Hussein Shikha, Noel W Anderson, Jennifer TEE
