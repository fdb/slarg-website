The Sint Lucas Antwerpen Research Group (SLARG) is delighted to invite you to their 2023 research week!

The SLARG researchers will provide you with an insider view on the plurality of their research methods and tools through workshops, presentations, seminars, performances, and much more. Join one or more of our events and catch a glimpse of their processes, experiments, and propositions.

To discover what is happening at SLARG on an ongoing basis, we invite you to join our research presentation afternoons on 16 and 17 October in the Sint Lucas Antwerpen Showroom.
We thank our dear partners Kunsthal Extra-City, Morpho and ARIA for making this possible.
