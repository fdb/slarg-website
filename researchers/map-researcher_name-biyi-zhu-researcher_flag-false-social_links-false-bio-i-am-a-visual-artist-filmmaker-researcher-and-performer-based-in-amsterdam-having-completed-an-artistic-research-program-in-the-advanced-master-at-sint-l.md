bio: I am a visual artist, filmmaker, researcher, and performer based in
  Amsterdam, having completed an artistic research program in the Advanced
  Master at Sint Lucas Antwerp. My work centers on time-based media and video
  experiments that immerse viewers in the complexities of human mobility across
  physical, virtual, symbolic, and imaginary spaces. By utilizing custom mobile
  shooting devices, I create thought-provoking pieces that engage with these
  themes. My recent research interests encompass memory, diaspora, and digital
  kinship. I undertake self-initiated projects as well as commissions from
  cultural institutions, festivals, and design studios, with exhibitions in the
  Netherlands, China, Germany, and beyond.
