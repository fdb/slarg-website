bio: I am a visual artist, filmmaker, researcher, and performer based in
  Amsterdam. I completed the Advanced Master of Research in Arts and Design
  program at Sint Lucas Antwerpen. My work centers on time-based media and video
  experiments that utilize custom mobile shooting devices to immerse viewers in
  the complexities of human mobility across physical, virtual, symbolic, and
  imaginary spaces. My recent research interests encompass memory, diaspora, and
  digital kinship. I undertake self-initiated projects as well as commissions
  from cultural institutions, festivals, and design studios, with exhibitions in
  the Netherlands, China, Germany, and beyond.
