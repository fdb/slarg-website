  Ayoh Kré Duchâtelet is a Belgian-Ivorian artist and writer who lives and works in Brussels. He conducts documentary research on colonial and contemporary situations. His research gives form to heterogeneous fictional assemblages that combine text, image, video and sound. He is nourished by a variety of questions concerning the relationship between affect, image and imperialism, and the construction and circulation of imaginaries in the context of what V.Y. Mudimbe has called "The Invention of Africa" and Joseph Tonda has called "Afrodystopia".


  Over the past few years, he has participated in the following group exhibitions: The Busan Biennale 2024, Seeing in the Dark (Busan), Branching Streams. Sketches of Kinship at Théodore Monod Museum (Dakar) in 2024, Style Congo. Heritage & Heresy at Civa (Brussels) in 2023,... ; His texts have been published by La Criée centre d’art contemporain (Rennes), Civa (Brussels), Ròt-Bò-Krik (La Grotte aux poissons aveugles to be published in october 2025). 


  Ayoh is doing a PhD in the arts at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG) / ARIA (University of Antwerp), entitled *Hearing room: Ghosts of the African Democratic Assembly.*
