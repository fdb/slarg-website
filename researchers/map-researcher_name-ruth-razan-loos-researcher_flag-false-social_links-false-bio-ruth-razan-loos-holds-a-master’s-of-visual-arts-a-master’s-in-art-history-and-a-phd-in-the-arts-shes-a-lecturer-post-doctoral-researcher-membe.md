bio: >-
  Ruth Razan Loos holds a master’s of Visual Arts, a master’s in Art History and
  a PhD in the Arts. She's a lecturer, post-doctoral researcher, member of the
  TYPP Board, the ARIA Steering Group, the St Lucas Board, … and supervisor of
  several PhDs in the Arts. As a policy maker, she supports St Lucas' research
  and develops its social outreach approach.


  As a member of various committees, she focuses on diversity and inclusion. She values participatory practices and a general concern for solidarity. For the past 5 years, she has been initiating and organising various events in close collaboration with Stadscanvas (Fameus), a space for artistic newcomers in Antwerp. Together they develop new partnerships, among others with the Plantin-Moretus Museum, Rataplan and Voem.


  Studying Modern Standard Arabic and volunteering as a language buddy for newcomers, led to a socio-political interest in our multilingual and multiscript world. How artists and designers critique, engage and propose a way of dealing with mono- and multilingual/multiscript realities is the focus of an elective course she teaches, and of a new Erasmus+ collaboration between Sint Lucas School of Arts Antwerp and the American University in Cairo.


  She's currently completing her one-year post-doctoral research project 'Closer than your jugular vein', which will lead to new initiatives where art and religion can come together.
