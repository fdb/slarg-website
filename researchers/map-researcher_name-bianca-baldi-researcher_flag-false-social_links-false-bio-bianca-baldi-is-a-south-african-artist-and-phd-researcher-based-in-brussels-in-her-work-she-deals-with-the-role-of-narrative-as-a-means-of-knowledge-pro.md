bio: >-
  Bianca Baldi is a South African artist and Phd researcher based in Brussels.
  In her work she deals with the role of narrative as a means of knowledge
  production in both fictional and historical contexts. She is interested in the
  staging of identity and history and explores these themes in photography,
  film, writing and publishing, which she often combines in the exhibition
  format as installations. 


  Her work has been featured in international exhibitions such as MOMENTA Biennale de l’Image in Tiohtià:ke/Mooniyang/Montreal, the 11th African Photography Biennale in Bamako, the 11th Shanghai Biennale, the 8th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art and group shows at Kunsthalle Bern, Extra City Kunsthal Antwerp, Kunstverein Braunschweig and Kunstverein Frankfurt. Recent solo exhibitions include Patina at Photoforum Pasquart (2022) and Cameo at Grazer Kunstverein (2021).
