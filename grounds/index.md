description: "\\*Grounds\\* is the renewed artistic research journal of Sint
  Lucas Antwerp. As the follow-up to TYPP, Grounds introduces a new editorial
  approach: editors become coaches, supporting researchers to experiment with
  publishing and open their artistic research to wider publics beyond academic
  communities."
