    description: >-
      How do photographs stage identity, memory, and community?


      On June 23, **Staged realities: Performing identity and studio photography** brings together artists and researchers exploring how studio photography becomes a site of performance, negotiation,and desire — across China, India, Morocco, Pakistan, and the UK. From family portraits to tourist fantasies, this half-day online seminar offers a rich dialogue between ethnography, archival reflection, self-staging, and public interventions.


      **23 June 2025, 14:00–17:30 CEST**\

      Online — free, registration required\

      With Caroline Molloy, Zhao Shuting (photo), Laila Hida, Cheryl Mukherji and Danial Shah


      \

      Initiated by SLARG PhD researcher Danial Shah, supported by Ruth Loos and Paolo Favero.

    section_title: "Grounds #1 launched during Antwerp Art Weekend "
    description: >-
      During Antwerp Art Weekend at Extra City Kunsthal, we proudly launched
      *Grounds #1* — the renewed artistic research journal of Sint Lucas
      Antwerp. As the follow-up to *TYPP*, *Grounds* introduces a new editorial
      approach: editors become coaches, supporting researchers to experiment
      with publishing and open their artistic research to wider publics beyond
      academic communities.


      The first issue brings together diverse voices, formats, and practices — capturing artistic research as a space of process, dialogue and multiple “grounds” for inquiry.


      The first issue features contributions by Joud Toamah, Pierre-Antoine Vettorello, Braver Spaces (Imane B.K. & Tundé Adefioye), Robin Vanbesien, Mona Hedayati, Viêt Vū, and Bianca Baldi — offering a rich mix of artistic inquiries, voices, and experimentations.


      *Grounds #1* is available at Sint Lucas Antwerpen. Pass by to pick up your free copy!
