    description: >-
      How do photographs stage identity, memory, and community?\

      On June 23, **Staged realities: Performing identity and studio photography** brings together artists and researchers exploring how studio photography becomes a site of performance, negotiation,and desire — across China, India, Morocco, Pakistan, and the UK. From family portraits to tourist fantasies, this half-day online seminar offers a rich dialogue between ethnography, archival reflection, self-staging, and public interventions.




      **23 June 2025, 14:00–17:30 CEST**\

      Online — free, registration required\

      With Caroline Molloy, Zhao Shuting (photo), Laila Hida, Cheryl Mukherji and Danial Shah


      \

      Initiated by SLARG PhD researcher Danial Shah, supported by Ruth Loos and Paolo Favero.
