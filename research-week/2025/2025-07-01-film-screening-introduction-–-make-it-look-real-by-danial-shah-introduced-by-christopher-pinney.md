On the occasion of **Danial Shah**’s PhD defense, we are proud to present a special screening of his debut film *Make It Look Real* (2024), a compelling documentary set in a small photo studio in Pakistan. With warmth and complexity, the film explores how clients imagine themselves through digitally constructed portraits—adding elements like guns, glamour, or muscle—to create images that “look real.” Shah’s film unfolds as a layered exploration of aspiration, masculinity, inequality, and friendship, blending the roles of filmmaker and subject in a subtle reworking of the documentary form.

The screening will be introduced by **Christopher Pinney**, professor of anthropology and visual culture at University College London. Pinney is a leading scholar of South Asian visual culture and the author of influential works such as *Camera Indica* and *Photos of the Gods*. His 15-minute introduction will situate Shah’s film in relation to broader questions around photography, fabrication, and self-representation.

*Make It Look Real* will be shown just prior to Shah’s public PhD defense, and all are welcome to attend both events. This moment marks the culmination of his research and a rare opportunity to experience a film deeply rooted in visual ethnography and collaborative storytelling.
