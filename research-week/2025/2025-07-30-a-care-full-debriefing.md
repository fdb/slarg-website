**The Spring Pears** are a geographically dispersed collective that emerged from the Sint Antwerpen Advanced Master of Research 2023–24, consisting of An-Marie Breem, Katy Drake, Kristí Fekete, Anthe Hermans, Saskia Van der Gucht and Yi Zhang.\
\
In 2025, we conducted an experimental artistic research project, exchanging our work through post packages. Each round was a response to the previously received message, shaped by six themes present in our individual practices.

This fall, we will come together for a four-day residency to transform these ongoing exchanges into a printed publication. The project reflects not only our artistic processes but also our dwellings between priority stamps and tracking, and the tangible outcomes of this collaborative experiment.  

In this session, we will present the completed publication, the artworks created, and the experiences and methodologies from our first collective endeavour.

*A Care-full Debriefing* draws its name from our shared interest in the ethics of care: a commitment to valuing relationships over results and recognising the work that care itself requires.

We welcome collectives and individuals interested in collaborative, care-focused art practices and self-organised publishing. Join us to explore our process, exchange insights, and engage in a conversation about the challenges and highlights of collective making.

Swap a copy of our printed publication for another. We welcome exchanges.

Let us know via **[springpears@tutamail.com](mailto:springpears@tutamail.com)** if you will join us, so we can prepare the space and chairs needed.
