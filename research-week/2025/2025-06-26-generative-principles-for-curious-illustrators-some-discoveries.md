**Sander Van de Vyver**, illustrator and SLARG researcher, presents a round-up of the **[Pockets of Control](https://slarg.be/projects/pockets-of-control/)** research project.

The talk is accessible for a general audience and explores a curious illustratorâ€™s forays into visual programming, system design and procedural generation.

It will be a love letter to roadside discoveries like double scattering, lo-fi proceduralism, decoupled systems and pixel shaders.

The talk combines broad conceptual ideas with anecdotal insights, inviting the potentially curious image maker to consider the role of the systematic in their gestural practice.
