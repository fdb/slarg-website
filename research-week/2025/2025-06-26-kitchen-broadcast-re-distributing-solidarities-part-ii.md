Kitchen Broadcast is an ongoing series of online conversations, listening in on friendly voices, rhythms and sounds in the Kitchen, a space in Brussels dedicated to collective practices, study and memorial justice.

For SLARG research week, Kitchen Broadcast airs a live program , introducing excerpts from Radio El Wafa (Devotion) and Sawt al Muhajir (Voice of the Wayfarer), two radios founded in Brussels in the 1980s. Drawing from a series of listening sessions, the live broadcast will explore possible ways of re-distributing translocal solidarities activated amongst the then still free radio stations. 

The live session of the Kitchen Broadcast is part of the research project Re:Sol, conducted by Joachim Ben Yakoub and Reem Shilleh. The research seeks sensible forms of memorial restitution. This particular broadcast is addressed to anyone who is interested in different forms of re-distribution of traces of engagement and possible forms of sonic and visual re-imagination of solidarities over time.
