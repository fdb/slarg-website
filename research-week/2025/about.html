<div>
    <p class="description"></p><p><strong>Welcome to our 2025 SLARG Research Week!</strong></p>
    <p>Join us for a week of discovery through <strong>workshops, sharing sessions, lectures, exhibitions</strong>, and a <strong>PhD defense</strong>, showcasing the work of our researchers in the arts and their invited guests.</p>
    <p>Research is always in progress and often built on fragile grounds. Thatâ€™s why we opt for <strong>sharing and exchanging</strong> in the <strong>informality and intimacy of small-scale events</strong>, so be sure to <strong>secure your seat</strong> by subscribing to events via the links provided on each event page.</p>
