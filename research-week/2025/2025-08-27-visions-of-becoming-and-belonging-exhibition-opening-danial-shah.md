**Danial Shah**, PhD researcher (SLARG/ViDi), warmly invites you to the opening of his exhibition *Becoming, Belonging and Vanishing* at FOMU â€“ Fotomuseum Antwerpen.

Through photography and film, Shah explores the world of photo studios in his hometown Quetta (Pakistan). Spaces originally characterized by hand painted backdrops, costumes and material props, these studios have today morphed into digital collage playgrounds. Nevertheless they still serve the original function as spaces for constructing and reworking identities, aspirations, and belongings. Â 

Shahâ€™s work highlights how people use these studios to project themselves into imagined realities and to construct themselves amidst changing personal dreams and social dramas. Â 

Shah's PhD research is supervised by Sint Lucas School of Arts Antwerp (KdG) and Visual and Digital Cultures Research Center (ViDi, University of Antwerp), partners of ARIA, Antwerp Research Institute for the Arts.Â
