**Danial Shah**, PhD researcher (SLARG/ARIA), warmly invites you to the opening of his exhibition *Becoming, Belonging and Vanishing* at FOMU â€“ Fotomuseum Antwerpen.

Rooted in his ongoing PhD research in the arts at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG) and the University of Antwerp (coordinated byâ€¯ARIA | Antwerp Research Institute for the Arts), supervised by Visual and Digital Cultures Research Center (ViDi). 

Through photography and film, Shah explores the world of photo studios in his hometown Quetta (Pakistan). Spaces originally characterized by hand painted backdrops, costumes and material props, these studios have today morphed into digital collage playgrounds. Nevertheless they still serve the original function as spaces for constructing and reworking identities, aspirations, and belongings.  

Shahâ€™s work highlights how people use these studios to project themselves into imagined realities and to construct themselves amidst changing personal dreams and social dramas.
