Making your artistic research process public is often expected of researchers, yet it is not always straightforward. Unlike presenting finished artistic outcomes, opening up your process requires careful reflection on the most suitable medium, as well as attention to questions of translation and accessibility.

In this session, several researchers in the arts will introduce the tools and strategies they use to make their research process visible. You will hear about the opportunities and difficulties they encounter, and there will be ample time for discussion. Together we will explore a wide range of formats: from zines, books, and websites, to the SAR Research Catalogue, academic articles, and conferences. The possibilities are many: the challenge lies in finding the approach that resonates most with your own practice. Come to exchange, reflect, and learn!
