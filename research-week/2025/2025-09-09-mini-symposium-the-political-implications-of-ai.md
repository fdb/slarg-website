This mini-symposium will be structured around short presentations (20 minutes each) followed by an extended discussion with the audience. Contributions will come from **Olya Kudina**, **Nicolas Malevé, Yj Erden, Freya van den Boom. Moderated by Imane B. K.**

Together we will ask:

* How do AI systems redistribute agency, visibility, and power?
* How do AI systems impact our ethical and political futures?

For **artists, researchers, students, and others working at the intersection of art, politics, and technology**, this symposium provides a space to critically reflect on how AI entangles with politics and power, and to explore how creative practices can respond to or resist its impact.

Join us in thinking through AI not only as a technical tool, but as a political and cultural force that reshapes our ways of seeing, knowing, imagining and relating to each other. 

*The image was generated with AI: an algorithmic imagination of togetherness, inviting us to reflect on its political and ethical implications.*
