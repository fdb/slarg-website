SLARG invites you to the launch of *EURO—VISION: Undergrounding the Critical Mineral* by the artist duo FRAUD.

Mining today reaches far beyond drills and quarries: it plays out in financial markets, legal frameworks, trade policies, and the very metrics that decide what counts as “critical.” From lithium and copper to the seabed and child labour, *EURO—VISION* examines how extraction is defined, legitimised, and contested in our time.

Bringing together artists, scholars, economists, activists, and journalists, the book explores the hidden infrastructures and governing logics of the mining sector. FRAUD introduce “undergrounding” as both method and provocation: a way to reveal the violence obscured by neutral data, and to rethink the mineral itself—its histories, its presence, and its futures.

Published in K. Verlag’s *Processing Process* series, *EURO—VISION* combines visual essays, interviews, and commissioned texts to open new perspectives on the entanglements of geology, economy, and power.
