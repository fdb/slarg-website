Countless times, I’ve stood in front of my library, searching through the shelves only to come up empty-handed, unable to find the books needed to create and discuss typography and design in my mother tongue, Western Armenian. 

*Missing Books* was born from this vision. It’s a mobile installation, a conceptual space that makes room for underrepresented and often "invisible" scripts. This travelling project functions as a toolbox, filled with evolving multilingual resources, stories, and voices long left out. It moves within and beyond institutions, through different diasporas, languages, and times, bringing together thinkers and designers to foster a community that shares ideas, co-creates and inspires one another.

In a world where contemporary typography design standards have become the norm, how do we unlearn and reshape our way of thinking while working with underrepresented scripts? How can we build a contemporary Armenian visual culture without simply mimicking dominant ones? Should we catch up or create our own temporality?

The installation will feature voices like **[Naïma Ben Ayed](https://naimabenayedbureau.com/about)**, envisioning collective spaces for archiving and letter-making, and **[Nina Paim](http://www.ninapaim.com)**, whose role as a “Greek Doulē” helps me guide these books into existence.
