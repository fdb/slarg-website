A (self)-investigation on the dramatic filmmaking scene in the neoliberal and authoritarian society of Vietnam since the early 2000s by a local queer experimental filmmaker.

These fragmented media are firstly extracts from Việt Vũ's own "memory work" on how his growth-up without a model as a homosexual adolescent in Vietnam facilitated his trajectory as a self-taught and independent filmmaker. Beyond that, they included textual (and visual) data from more than 20 interviews that Việt Vũ have made with his fellow filmmakers, especially independent ones, about the contemporary film making scene in Vietnam since early 2000s. Narrating from a first-person point of view, the filmmaker/researcher is trying to paint a collective portrait of a new and bold generation of filmmakers in a socio-political context that exist peculiarly repressing and conflicting push-and-pull factors.
