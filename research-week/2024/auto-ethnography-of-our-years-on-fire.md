A (self)-investigation in the dramatic filmmaking scene in the neoliberal and authoritarian society of Vietnam since the early 2000s by a local queer experimental filmmaker.

The fragmented media on display are extracts from Việt Vũ's own "memory work". They show how growing-up in Vietnam as a homosexual adolescent without a role-model facilitated his trajectory as a self-taught and independent filmmaker. Beyond that, these extracts include textual and visual data from more than 20 interviews that Việt Vũ made with his fellow filmmakers, especially independent ones, about the contemporary film making scene in Vietnam since the early 2000s. Narrating from a first-person point of view, the filmmaker/researcher is trying to paint a collective portrait of a new and bold generation of filmmakers in a socio-political context that is marked by peculiarly repressing and conflicting push-and-pull factors.
