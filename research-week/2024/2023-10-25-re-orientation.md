This is an experimental performance developed on the premise of exploring and studying the mother-daughter relationship during my Advanced Master at Sint Lucas Antwerpen. By manipulating a sphere equipped with a live camera, I explore the interaction between the physical and virtual realms. As I engage with the sphere, the images captured from unconventional angles challenge the audience’s preconceived perceptions of their own existence and the surrounding space, prompting reflection on concrete experiences.

In a series of performances involving the body and the sphere, I ask myself: “How do I view and understand my life from a non-linear, non-normative perspective through the lens of queer migration?” These perspectives help me bridge the distance and closeness shaped by migrant life experiences—the absence of moments that cannot be fully expressed and shared in my mother tongue, and the sense of loss in realizing the inability to create shared memories after attempting to communicate with my mother.

My creative process has led me to re-examine the subtle relationship between family memory and the traces of life shared between mother and daughter by continuing to establish a visual language of communication that transcends both the mother tongue and foreign languages.

**This performance is part of a performance program that runs in the chapel next to Sint Lucas Antwerpen.**

**Duration: 30-40 min**
