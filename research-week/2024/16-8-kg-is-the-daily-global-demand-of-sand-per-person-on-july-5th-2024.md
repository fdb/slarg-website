'16.8 kg is the daily global demand of sand per person on June 5th, 2024' is an installation consisting of 15 objects which together contain 16.8 kg of river sand. The packaging is made by hand in textile, wood cardboard and flocked paper. The objects reference food packaging in rations calculating the daily demand of sand, the earth’s most mined material.\
According to the United Nations Environment Programme 50 billion tons of sand is extracted from lakes, riverbeds, coastlines and deltas each year. Per person, with an estimated 8.113.691.999 people on earth on June 5th, 2024, that is approximately 6170 kilogram per year - the weight of a minke whale or a loaded standard shipping container.\
\
My research project ‘on sand: unpacking preciousness’ questions what the role of packaging could be, in understanding our capitalocenic interdependence with living and non-living beings.
