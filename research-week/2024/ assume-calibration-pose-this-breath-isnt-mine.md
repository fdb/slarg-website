The piece features two beings whose movements and behavior are shaped by the technological devices they wear. The dancer's motion capture suit is equipped with sensors that transmit her movements to the oboist's hands. The oboist, in turn, receives these signals through a custom-designed hand prototype that vibrates, enabling her to musically respond to the dancer’s actions. This exchange of haptic feedback transforms how they relate to their bodies, allowing them to explore new ways of interacting with the technology around them.

We aim to understand how this setup functions as a form of communication, examining the power dynamics involved when we submit to these technologies, and how intimacy can be found between the performers through this interaction. Surrendering to technology involves embracing not only its potential, but also the constraints of the motion-capture suit and the haptic feedback glove. From this point, we began experimenting with movements, sounds, and forms of connection. We sought to perceive the body as an extended version of itself, exploring the intersection of machine and human and how they shape one another. We discovered how the mechanical is embedded in our humanity, and how our humanity, in turn, resides within the machine
