A panel composed of strips of various types of wood. Leftover pieces from furniture boards. The horizontal grains of the wood suggest a landscape â€” whether it references historical painting, or a hypothetical landscape of the future remains undefined. Often, imagined images within future thinking work with the concept of landscape and horizon, encompassing what may lie beyond the horizon.

As a layer on top of the work, there is a relief illustrating a cluster diagram. Carved lines connect different circular spheres. These spheres consist of various types of loam. The diagram is not a one-to-one translation of concrete data but rather follows a visual language that is applied in the domain of infographics. An apparent correlation between different clusters suggests assessable possibilities for how the future may unfold. But what is predictable, what is plausible, or what is desirable? This representation navigates between visualizing the concrete and the aesthetic material translation of what is and what may be possible.
