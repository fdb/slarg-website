The piece presents two creatures that move and behave influenced by the technological engines given to them. The sensors in the motion capture suit the dancer wears, send her movements to the oboist's hands. The oboist receives these signals through a custom-built hand prototype that vibrates, allowing her to musically respond to the dancer's actions. Through this haptic feedback process, the relationship they establish with their bodies is transformed, allowing them to discover different ways of interacting with the technology that surrounds them. 

We try to understand how the setup works as a means of communication, what the power structures are when we surrender to these technologies and how we find intimacy between two performers through the technological setup. The surrender to technology means not only a surrender to its possibilities, but also to the motion-tracking suit and to the haptic feedback glove. From there, we started searching for movements, sounds, ways of relating to each other. We wanted to understand our body as an extended version of itself. We explored the confluence of machine and humanity and how they influence each other, and how the machinic resides in our humanity and vice versa.
