These "dome" (dolls in wolof) are inspired by Senegalese tradition, where the making of dolls plays a crucial role in shaping feminine identity. In Abdoulaye Sadji's novel Ma√Ømouna (1958), the protagonist and her doll Nabou are inseparable, symbolizing the transition from childhood to adulthood. The Saint-Louis fashion historian, Fatou Niang Siga (1932-2022), had already explored the role of dolls as a key element in reconstructing the history of Senegalese fashion. These three dolls, handcrafted by the artist and dressed in textiles that have been hand-dyed and/or made by artisans from Saint-Louis, represent a collective practice to reimagine and fabulate the fashion traditions of women from Senegal and the diaspora.
