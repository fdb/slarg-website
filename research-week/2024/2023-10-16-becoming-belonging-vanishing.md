This mixed reality interactive display questions the boundaries between the real and the unreal. The physical becomes digital, the tangible turns virtual and digital turns objects. We explore the transition of a photo studio in Quetta, Pakistan, examining the interplay between the past and present, reality and unreality. 

The advancement of photographic technology, particularly the commonness of mobile phones with cameras, has led to the shutdown of photo studios. What was once a communal event—visiting a photo studio—has largely faded, and with that, its aesthetics as well. This installation uses the same technology that caused the decline of the photo studio, where we experience a once-shared aesthetic experience, creating a virtual world within real space. Visible glitches in these virtual spaces mirror the deliberate manipulations in studio photography—fantasies crafted to appear real.
