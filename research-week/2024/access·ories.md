Take a deep breath in through your nose, and a deep breath out through your mouth... In a few breaths we will meet in a parallel space-time in which we can share and dream stories of empowerment through publishing, in an expanded understanding of the term, including oral transmission and hybrid~cyborg formats.·՞ ՟ ՚

This installation presents work in progress around accessories as portals for subversive publishing stories. It shows small plexiglas tables of different heights, and on top of them a series of accessories, ranging from ԱԲԳ press on nails, emotional punctuation earrings, cushions with an audio-guided fabulation to bookends for softly bound publications.

It is an experiment as part of the research project *The politics of publishing: researching encounters between artists’ books and intersectional feminist tools* which addresses artists’ books and the politics of publishing, creating forms to uncover forgotten histories in this field, through a critical design approach which includes feminist tools.

Visual: parenthesis font project in collaboration with Lara Dautun.
