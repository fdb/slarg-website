*Artistic participation project along the river Dijle with designer Annelys de Vet (PhD candidate ARIA) & Leen Maes (consultant De Natuuracademie). With Sint Lucas School of Arts & Natuurpunt, Spring – Winter 2024*

*Voices from the Drought* is an artistic participatory project focused on alternative forms of water management. Energised by guided walks through one of Belgium’s most beautiful nature reserves (along the Dijle River), local and international nature enthusiasts—with lived experiences of drought and flooding—have explored and depicted various perspectives on water and drought. Perspectives were drawn from dried-up lakes in Mexico to vanished rivers in Isfahan and from the dykes in the Netherlands to the water bomb in Wallonia, emphasising the formative force water has on all of us. De Vet facilitated the sharing of these narratives during site-specific, hands-on workshops, where participants sketched specific water structures they grew up with, painted wet details using water from the Dijle, created dry landscapes in a herbarium, and wrote personal water biographies about how water had shaped their lives.

Entangled, these ‘voices’ offer diverse imaginations of water, highlighting its role in connecting us all and the disconnection caused by drought. The project aims to contribute to a more culturally inclusive and visually rich discourse on drought, flooding, and climate change. 

The visual works and narratives will be shared with a broader audience through a travelling exhibition, a publication, and a digital archive, each prompting new audiences to relate with care and imagination to water.

A selection of the ‘dry landscapes’ will be presented to the public for the first time at the SLARG exhibition, followed by an exhibition at the Public Library in Oud Heverlee in January.
