This tiny exhibit will consist of a series of audio recordings and text that were created in the Summer of 2024. A Summer where an apparent unraveling was being fermented after a Spring that created a rupture and a blooming of fungal sepsis. The audio recordings, text and accompanying images (taken in 2022 and 2023) will allow observers to get a very limited glimpse of a process of creating spaces, so called braver, that was implanted at the end of 2020 and began to really sprout in 2021. And since then these spaces have often dreamed greener pastures that were not fully manifested but nevertheless the green leaves that held pods felt for some (far from all) like a welcomed and warm place to imagine other possibilities.

This is part of a one-year research project called *Towards Braver Spaces* which investigates the creation and sustainability of "Braver Spaces" in Antwerp. The study explores collective art-based practices that support artistic development and incorporate care as a practice. The project will examine past implementations of Braver Spaces, the methods used since its inception in 2021, and future possibilities. Key research questions include the nature and impact of braver spaces, their limitations, and the lessons these limitations can teach for future iterations.
