  <p>Do you want to join SLARG and do a PhD in the arts at Sint Lucas Antwerpen (KdG)/ARIA (University of Antwerp)?</p>

  <p>SLARG is delighted to launch its call for four PhD projects in visual arts.</p>
  <p>The successful candidate receives a 50% assistant postion at Sint Lucas Antwerpen and is admitted to the doctoral program of ARIA (University of Antwerp). The research duration is four years, starting with a 2-year contract that is once renewable upon positive evaluation.</p>

  <p>For the 2025 call, there are four fellowships available. One of these is reserved for a pilot collaboration with Jan van Eyck Academie, Maastricht, The Netherlands.</p>

  <p>The fellowship in collaboration with Jan van Eyck is thematically defined as follows:</p>

  <em>We invite proposals in artistic research that explore the ways center, periphery, and margin are reconfigured through circulation in contemporary art. While artists deeply engage with local communities and infrastructures of resistance, they also navigate the temporality of residencies, exhibitions, and mobility. What happens to situated practice when it relocates? What traces, absences, or continuities does it leave behind? Combining theory and research-creation, the PhD project shall examine how dwelling, movement, and return shape artistic methodologies, aesthetics, and ethics.</em>

  <p>Jan van Eyck Academie offers the selected PhD fellow:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>3 months/year the possibility to join the Jan van Eyck community: the fellow will have a private studio space, will have access to Jan van Eyck advisers, can make use of the expertise of the Labs, and can join the (public) programme of the academy</li>
  <li>1000€/year production budget</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The due date for applications is 1 March 2026.  Please indicate on the application form if you are specifically applying for the collaboration with Jan van Eyck Academy! </p>
